    <introduction>
    <p>
      We have now studied at length how curves in space can be defined parametrically by functions of the form <m>\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle</m>, and surfaces can be represented by functions <m>z = f(x,y)</m>. In what follows, we will see how we can also define surfaces parametrically. A one-dimensional curve in space results from a vector function that relies upon one parameter, so a two-dimensional surface naturally involves the use of two parameters. If <m>x = x(s, t)</m>, <m>y = y(s, t)</m>, and <m>z = z(s, t)</m> are functions of independent parameters <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, then the terminal points of all vectors of the form
      <me>
        \vr(s, t) = x(s, t) \vi + y(s, t) \vj + z(s, t) \vk
      </me>
      form a surface in space. The equations <m>x=x(s,t)</m>, <m>y=y(s,t)</m>, and <m>z=z(s,t)</m> are the <em>parametric equations</em><idx><h>parameterization</h><h>surface</h></idx> for the surface, or a <em>parametrization</em> of the surface. In <xref ref="PA_11_6">Preview Activity</xref> we investigate how to parameterize a cylinder and a cone.

              Just as a cylinder can be viewed as a <q>stack</q> of circles of constant radius, a cone can be viewed as a stack of circles with varying radius.  Modify the parametrizations of the circles above in order to construct the parameterization of a cone whose vertex lies at the origin, whose base radius is 4, and whose height is 3, where the base of the cone lies in the plane <m>z = 3</m>. Use appropriate technology to plot the parametric equations you develop. (Hint: The cross sections parallel to the <m>xy</m>-plane are circles, with the radii varying linearly as <m>z</m> increases.)

    <title>Parametric Surfaces</title>
    <p>
      In a single-variable setting, any function may have its graph expressed parametrically. For instance, given <m>y = g(x)</m>, by considering the parameterization <m>\langle t, g(t) \rangle</m> (where <m>t</m> belongs to the domain of <m>g</m>), we generate the same curve. What is more important is that certain curves that are not functions may be represented parametrically; for instance, the circle (which cannot be represented by a single function) can be parameterized by <m>\langle \cos(t), \sin(t) \rangle</m>, where <m>0 \le t \le 2\pi</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same way, in a two-variable setting, the surface <m>z = f(x,y)</m> may be expressed parametrically by considering
      <me>
        \langle x(s,t), y(s,t), z(s,t) \rangle = \langle s, t, f(s,t) \rangle,
      </me>
      where <m>(s,t)</m> varies over the entire domain of <m>f</m>. Therefore, any familiar surface that we have studied so far can be generated as a parametric surface. But what is more powerful is that there are surfaces that cannot be generated by a single function <m>z = f(x,y)</m> (such as the unit sphere), but that can be represented parametrically. We now consider an important example.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_11_6_Torus">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the
          torus (or doughnut) shown in <xref ref="F_11_6_torus">Figure</xref>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="F_11_6_torus" >
          <caption>A torus.</caption>
          <image width="50%" source="images/fig_11_6_torus" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          To find a parametrization of this torus, we recall our work in Preview
          <xref ref="PA_11_6">Activity</xref>. There, we saw that a circle of radius <m>r</m>
          that has its center at the point <m>(0,0,z_0)</m> and is contained in the
          horizontal plane <m>z = z_0</m>, as shown in <xref ref="F_11_6_revolve">Figure</xref>, can be
          parametrized using the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> defined by
          <me>
            \vr(t) = r\cos(t)\vi + r\sin(t)\vj + z_0\vk
          </me>
          where <m>0\leq t\leq 2\pi</m>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="F_11_6_revolve" >

        </figure>

        <p>
          To obtain the torus in <xref ref="F_11_6_torus">Figure</xref>, we begin with a circle of radius <m>a</m> in the
          <m>xz</m>-plane centered at <m>(b,0)</m>, as shown
          on the left of <xref ref="F_11_6_torus_revolve">Figure</xref>. We may parametrize
          the points on this circle, using the parameter <m>s</m>, by using the equations
          <me>
            x(s) = b + a\cos(s)\ \mbox{and} \ 
            z(s) = a\sin(s),
          </me>
          where <m>0\leq s \leq 2\pi</m>.
        </p>

          <image source="images/fig_11_6_torus_revolve" />
          </sidebyside>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Let's focus our attention on one point on this circle, such as the
          indicated point, which has coordinates <m>(x(s), 0, z(s))</m>
          for a fixed value of the
          parameter <m>s</m>. When this point is revolved about the <m>z</m>-axis, we
          obtain a circle contained in a horizontal plane centered at
          <m>(0,0,z(s))</m> and having radius <m>x(s)</m>, as shown on the right of <xref ref="F_11_6_torus_revolve">Figure</xref>. If we let <m>t</m> be the new parameter that generates the circle for the rotation about the <m>z</m>-axis, this circle may be
          parametrized by
          <me>
            \vr(s,t) = x(s)\cos(t)\vi + x(s)\sin(t)\vj + z(s)\vk.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Now using our earlier parametric equations for <m>x(s)</m> and <m>z(s)</m> for the original smaller circle, we have an overall parameterization of the torus given by
          <me>
            \vr(s,t) =(b+a\cos(s))\cos(t)\vi + 
            (b+a\cos(s))\sin(t)\vj + 
            a\sin(s)\vk.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          To trace out the entire torus, we require that the parameters vary through the values <m>0\leq s\leq 2\pi</m> and
          <m>0\leq t\leq 2\pi</m>.

    <title>The Surface Area of Parametrically Defined Surfaces</title>
    <p>
      Recall that a differentiable function is locally linear <mdash /> that is, if we zoom in on the surface around a point, the surface looks like its tangent plane. We now exploit this idea in order to determine the surface area generated by a parametrization <m>\langle x(s,t), y(s,t), z(s,t) \rangle</m>. The basic idea is a familiar one: we will subdivide the surface into small pieces, in the approximate shape of small parallelograms, and thus estimate the entire the surface area by adding the areas of these approximation parallelograms. Ultimately, we use an integral to sum these approximations and determine the exact surface area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let
      <me>
        \vr(s,t) = x(s,t) \vi + y(s,t) \vj + z(s,t) \vk
      </me>
      define a surface over a rectangular domain <m>a \leq s \leq b</m> and <m>c \leq t \leq d</m>. As a function of two variables, <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, it is natural to consider the two partial derivatives of the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>, which we define by
      <md>
        <mrow>
        \vr_s(s,t) \amp = x_s(s,t) \vi + y_s(s,t) \vj + z_s(s,t) \vk
        </mrow>
        <mrow> 
        \vr_t(s,t) \amp = x_t(s,t) \vi + y_t(s,t) \vj + z_t(s,t) \vk.
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the usual way, we slice the domain into small rectangles. In particular, we partition the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>m</m> subintervals of length <m>\Delta s = \frac{b-a}{n}</m> and let <m>s_0</m>, <m>s_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>s_m</m> be the endpoints of these subintervals, where <m>a = s_0\lt s_1\lt s_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  s_m = b</m>. Also partition the interval <m>[c,d]</m> into <m>n</m> subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta t = \frac{d-c}{n}</m> and let <m>t_0</m>, <m>t_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>t_n</m> be the endpoints of these subintervals, where <m>c = t_0\lt t_1\lt t_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  t_n = d</m>. These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle <m>R = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m> in <m>st</m>-coordinates into <m>mn</m> sub-rectangles <m>R_{ij}</m> with opposite vertices <m>(s_{i-1},t_{j-1})</m> and <m>(s_i, t_j)</m> for <m>i</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>m</m> and <m>j</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>n</m>. These rectangles all have equal area <m>\Delta A = \Delta s \cdot \Delta t</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we want to think about the small piece of area on the surface itself that lies above one of these small rectangles in the domain.
      Observe that if we increase <m>s</m> by a small amount <m>\Delta s</m> from the point
      <m>(s_{i-1},t_{j-1})</m> in the domain, then <m>\vr</m> changes by approximately
      <m>\vr_s(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta s</m>. Similarly, if we increase <m>t</m> by a
      small amount <m>\Delta t</m> from the point <m>(s_{i-1},t_{j-1})</m>, then <m>\vr</m>
      changes by approximately <m>\vr_t(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta t</m>. So we can
      approximate the surface defined by <m>\vr</m> on the <m>st</m>-rectangle
      <m>[s_{i-1},s_i] \times [t_{j-1}, t_{j}]</m> with the
      parallelogram determined by the vectors <m>\vr_s(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta
      s</m> and <m>\vr_t(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta t</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F_11_6_approx">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F_11_6_approx" >
      <caption>Approximation surface area with a parallelogram.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/fig_11_6_approx" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Say that the small parallelogram has area <m>S_{ij}</m>. If we can find its area, then all that remains is to sum the areas of all of the generated parallelograms and take a limit. Recall from our earlier work in the course that given two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, the area of the parallelogram spanned by <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> is given by the magnitude of their cross product, <m>| \vu \times \vv|</m>. In the present context, it follows that the area, <m>S_{ij}</m>, of the parallelogram determined by the vectors <m>\vr_s(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta s</m> and <m>\vr_t(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta t</m> is
      <mdn>
        <mrow number="no">
        S_{ij} \amp = |(\vr_s(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta s) \times (\vr_t(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta t)| 
        </mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_11_6_parallelogram_area" >
          \amp = |\vr_s(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \times \vr_t(s_{i-1},t_{j-1})| \Delta s \Delta t,
        </mrow>
      </mdn>
      where the latter equality holds from standard properties of the cross product and length.
    </p>

    <p>
      We sum the surface area approximations from Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_11_6_parallelogram_area" /> over all sub-rectangles to obtain an estimate for the total surface area, <m>S</m>, given by
      <me>
        S \approx \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n |\vr_s(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \times \vr_t(s_{i-1},t_{j-1})| \Delta s \Delta t.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking the limit as <m>m, n \to \infty</m> shows that the surface area of the surface defined by <m>\vr</m> over the domain <m>D</m> is given as follows.

            Recall that one way to think about the surface area of a cylinder is to cut the cylinder horizontally and find the perimeter of the resulting cross sectional circle, then multiply by the height.  Calculate the surface area of the given cylinder using this alternate approach, and compare your work in (b).

      As we noted earlier, we can take any surface <m>z = f(x,y)</m> and generate a corresponding parameterization for the surface by writing <m>\langle s, t, f(s,t) \rangle</m>. Hence, we can use our recent work with parametrically defined surfaces to find the surface area that is generated by a function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> over a given domain.
