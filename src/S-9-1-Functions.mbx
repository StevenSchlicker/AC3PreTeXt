    <introduction>
    <p>
      Throughout our mathematical careers we have studied functions of a
      single variable. We define a function of one variable as a rule that
      assigns exactly one output to each input. We analyze these functions
      by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating,
      integrating, and more. Functions of several variables will be the main focus of Chapters 10 and 11, where we will analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. We will see that many of the ideas from single variable calculus translate well to functions of several variables, but we will have to make some adjustments as well. In this chapter we introduce functions of several variables and then discuss some of the tools (vectors and vector-valued functions) that will help us understand and analyze functions of several variables.

    <title>Functions of Several Variables</title>
    <p>
      Up to this point we have been concerned with functions of a single variable. What defined such a function is that every input in the domain produced a unique output in the range. We saw similar behavior in <xref ref="PA-9-1">Preview Activity</xref>, where each pair <m>(P,t)</m> of inputs produces a unique output <m>A(P,t)</m>. Additionally, the two variables <m>P</m> and <m>t</m> had no real relation to each other. That is, we could choose any value of <m>P</m> without considering what value <m>t</m> might have, and we could select any value of <m>t</m> to use without regard to what value <m>P</m> might have. For that reason we say that the variables <m>t</m> and <m>P</m> are <em>independent</em> of each other. Thus, we call <m>A = A(P,t)</m> a function of the two independent variables <m>P</m> and <m>t</m>. This is the key idea in defining a function of two independent variables. 
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>function <m>f</m> of two independent variables</term><idx><h>function</h><h>of two variables</h></idx> is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m> in some set <m>D</m> exactly one real number <m>f(x,y)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      There is, of course, no reason to restrict ourselves to functions of
      only two variables<mdash />we can use any number of variables we like. For
      example,
      <me>
        f(x,y,z) = x^2 - 2xz + \cos(y)
      </me>
      defines <m>f</m> as a function of the
      three variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>. In general, a function of <m>n</m>
      independent variables is a rule that assigns to an ordered <m>n</m>-tuple
      <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)</m> in some set <m>D</m> exactly one real number.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with functions of a single variable, it is important to understand
      the set of inputs for which the function is defined.

  <subsection>
    <title>Representing Functions of Two Variables</title>
    <p>
      One of the techniques we use to study functions of one
      variable is to create a table of values. We can do the same for
      functions of two variables, except that our tables will have to allow
      us to keep track of both input variables. We can do this with a
      2-dimensional table, where we list the <m>x</m>-values down the first column
      and the <m>y</m>-values across the first row. 

      As an example, suppose we launch a projectile, using a golf club, a cannon, or some other device, from ground level. Under ideal conditions (ignoring wind resistance, spin, or any other forces except the force of gravity) the
      horizontal distance the object will travel depends on the initial
      velocity <m>x</m> the object is given, and the angle <m>y</m> at which it is
      launched. If we let <m>f</m> represent the horizontal distance the object
      travels, then <m>f</m> is a function of the two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and we represent <m>f</m> in functional notation by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{g},
      </me>
      where <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity. (Note that <m>g</m> is constant, 32 feet per second squared. We will derive this equation in a later section.)
      To create a table of values for <m>f</m>, we list the <m>x</m>-values down the first column and the <m>y</m>-values across the first row. The value <m>f(x,y)</m> is then displayed in the location where the <m>x</m> row intersects the <m>y</m> column, as shown in <xref ref="T-9-1-range">Table</xref> (where we measure <m>x</m> in feet per second and <m>y</m> in radians).
    </p>

      the form <m>(x,y,f(x,y))</m> are in three dimensions, so plotting these
      points takes a bit more work than graphs of functions in two
      dimensions. To plot these three-dimensional points, we need to set up
      a coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes <mdash /> the
      <m>x</m>-axis, the <m>y</m>-axis, and the <m>z</m>-axis (called the <em>coordinate
      axes</em>). There are essentially two different ways we could set up a
      3D coordinate system, as shown in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand">Figure</xref>; thus, before we can proceed, we need to establish a convention.
    </p>

    <p>
      The distinction between these two figures is subtle, but important. In the coordinate system shown at left in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand">Figure</xref>, imagine that you are sitting on the positive <m>z</m>-axis next to the label <q><m>z</m>.</q> Looking down at the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes, you see that the <m>y</m>-axis is obtained by rotating the <m>x</m>-axis by 90<m>^\circ</m> in the <em>clockwise</em> direction. Again sitting on the positive <m>z</m>-axis in the coordinate system at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand">Figure</xref>, you see that the <m>y</m>-axis is obtained by rotating the <m>x</m>-axis by 90<m>^\circ</m> in the <em>counterclockwise</em>
      direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      We call the coordinate system at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand"></xref> a <em>right-hand system</em>; if we point the index finger of our <em>right</em>
      hand along the positive <m>x</m>-axis and our middle finger along the
      positive <m>y</m>-axis, then our thumb points in the direction of the
      positive <m>z</m>-axis. Following mathematical conventions, we choose to
      use a right-hand system throughout this book.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that we have established a convention for a right-hand system, we can draw a graph of the distance function defined by <m>f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}</m>. Note that the function <m>f</m> is continuous in both variables, so when we plot these points in the right hand coordinate system, we can connect them all to form a surface in 3-space. The graph of the distance function <m>f</m> is shown in <xref ref="F-9-1-range">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      There are many graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces as indicated in the Preface (see Links to interactive graphics in Features of the Text). Since we will be able to visualize graphs of functions of two independent variables, but not functions of more than two variables, we will primarily deal with functions of two variables in this text. It is important to note, however, that the techniques we develop apply to functions of any number of variables.

    <title>Some Standard Equations in Three-Space</title>
    <p>
      In addition to graphing functions, we will also want to understand
      graphs of some simple equations in three dimensions. For example, in
      <m>\R^2</m>, the graphs of the equations <m>x=a</m> and <m>y=b</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
      are constants, are lines parallel to the coordinate axes. In the next
      activity we consider their three-dimensional analogs.

    <title>Traces</title>
    <p>
      When we study functions of several variables we are often interested
      in how each individual variable affects the function in and of
      itself. In <xref ref="PA-9-1">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw that the amount of money in an account depends on the interest rate and the
      duration of the investment. However, if we fix the interest rate, the
      amount of money in the account depends only on the duration of the investment, and if we set the duration of the investment constant, then the amount of money in the account depends only on the interest rate. This
      idea of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to
      change will be an important tool for us when studying functions of
      several variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      As another example, consider again the distance function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}
      </me>
      where <m>x</m> is the initial velocity of an object in feet per second, <m>y</m> is the launch angle in radians, and <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity (32 feet per second squared). If we hold the launch angle constant at <m>y=0.6</m> radians, we can consider <m>f</m> a function of the initial velocity alone. In this case we have
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{x^2}{32}\sin(2\cdot 0.6).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the
      surface when <m>y = 0.6</m>, as shown at left in <xref ref="F-9-1-trace1">Figure</xref>. The formula clearly shows that <m>f</m> is quadratic in the <m>x</m>-direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch velocity while keeping the launch angle constant, the horizontal distance the object travels increases proportional to the square of the initial velocity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, if we fix the initial velocity at 150 feet per second, we
      can consider the distance as a function of the launch angle only. In this
      case we have
      <me>
        f(y) = \frac{150^2 \sin(2y)}{32}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can again plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when <m>x=150</m>, as shown at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-trace1">Figure</xref>. The formula clearly show that <m>f</m> is sinusoidal in the <m>y</m>-direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch angle while keeping the initial velocity constant, the horizontal distance traveled by the object is proportional to the sine of twice the launch
      angle.

      Mountains in the upper peninsula of Michigan shown in <xref ref="F-9-1-porcupine">Figure</xref>.<fn>Map source: Michigan Department of Natural Resources, with permission of the Michigan DNR and Bob Wild.</fn> The curves on these maps show the regions of constant altitude. The contours also depict changes in altitude: contours that are close together signify steep ascents or descents, while contours that are far apart indicate only slight changes in elevation. Thus, contour maps tell us a lot about three-dimensional surfaces. Mathematically, if <m>f(x,y)</m> represents the altitude at the point <m>(x,y)</m>, then each contour is the graph of an equation of the form <m>f(x,y) = k</m>, for some constant <m>k</m>.

      The traces and level curves of a function of two variables are curves
      in space. In order to understand these traces and level curves better,
      we will first spend some time learning about vectors and vector-valued
      functions in the next few sections and return to our study of
      functions of several variables once we have those more mathematical
      tools to support their study.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of several variables is a rule that assigns a unique number to an ordered collection of independent inputs.  The domain of a function of several variables is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          In <m>\R^3</m>, the distance between points <m>P=(x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> and <m>Q=(x_1, y_1, z_1)</m> (denoted as <m>|PQ|</m>)  is given by the formula
          <me>
            |PQ| = \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2 + (z_1-z_0)^2}.
          </me>
          and thus the equation of a sphere with center <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> and radius <m>r</m> is
          <me>
            (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A trace of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>z = f(c,y)</m> or <m>z = f(x,c)</m>, where <m>c</m> is a constant. A trace tells us how the function depends on a single independent variable if we treat the other independent variable as a constant.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A level curve of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>k = f(x,y)</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant. A level curve describes the set of inputs that lead to a specific output of the function.
        </p>
      </li>

        When people buy a large ticket item like a
        car or a house, they often take out a loan to make the purchase. The
        loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of
        the loan, plus interest, is paid. The monthly payment that the
        borrower has to make depends on the amount <m>P</m> of money borrowed
        (called the principal), the duration <m>t</m> of the loan in years, and
        the interest rate <m>r</m>. For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy a car, the monthly payment <m>M</m> that we need to make to pay off the loan is given by the formula
        <me>
          M(r,t) = \frac{1500r}{1-\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}}.
