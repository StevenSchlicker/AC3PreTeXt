    <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we will study limits of
      functions of several variables, with a focus on limits of functions
      of two variables. In single variable calculus, we studied the notion of limit, which turned out to be a critical
      concept that formed the basis for the derivative and the definite
      integral. In this section we will begin to understand how the concept
      of limit for functions of two variables is similar to what we
      encountered for functions of a single variable.
      The limit will again be the fundamental
      idea in multivariable calculus, and we will use this notion of the limit
      of a function of several variables to define the important concept of
      differentiability later in this chapter. We have already seen its use in the derivatives of vector-valued functions in <xref ref="S-9-7-Vector-Valued-Functions-Derivatives">Section</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's begin by reviewing what we mean by the
      limit of a function of one variable. We say that a function <m>f</m> has a limit <m>L</m> as
      <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> provided that we can make the values <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like
      by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close (but not equal) to <m>a</m>. We denote this behavior by writing
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to a}f(x) = L.
      </me>
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Limits of Functions of Two Variables</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_10_1">Preview Activity</xref>, we recalled the notion of limit
      from single variable calculus and saw that a similar concept applies
      to functions of two variables.
      Though we will focus on functions of two variables, for the sake of
      discussion, all the ideas we establish here are valid for functions of
      any number of variables. In a natural followup to our work in <xref ref="PA_10_1">Preview Activity</xref>,
      we now formally define what it means for a function of two variables to have a
      limit at a point.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a function <m>f = f(x,y)</m>, we say that <m>f</m>
          <term>has limit <m>L</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(a,b)</m></term> provided that we can make
          <m>f(x,y)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>(x,y)</m>
          sufficiently close (but not equal) to <m>(a,b)</m>. We write
          <me>
            \lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = L.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      To investigate the limit of a single variable function, <m>\lim_{x\to
        a}f(x)</m>, we often consider the behavior of <m>f</m> as <m>x</m> approaches
      <m>a</m> from the right and from the left. Similarly, we may investigate
      limits of two-variable functions, <m>\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y)</m> by
      considering the behavior of <m>f</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(a,b)</m> from
      various directions. This situation is more complicated because there
      are infinitely many ways in which <m>(x,y)</m> may approach <m>(a,b)</m>. In the next activity, we
      see how it is important to consider a variety of those paths in investigating whether or not a limit exists.

    <p>
      This activity shows that we need to be careful when studying the limit of a two-variable functions by considering its behavior along different paths. If we find two different paths that result in two different limits, then we may conclude that the limit does not exist. However, we can never conclude that the limit of a function exists only by considering its behavior along different paths.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally speaking, concluding that a limit
      <m>\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y)</m> exists requires a more careful argument. 
    </p>

      <example xml:id="A_10_1_Limit_exists">
      <p>
      Consider the function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2}.
      </me>
      We want to know  whether <m>\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)</m> exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that if either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is 0, then <m>f(x,y) = 0</m>. Therefore, if
      <m>f</m> has a limit at <m>(0,0)</m>, it must be 0. We will therefore argue
      that
      <me>
        \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y) = 0,
      </me>
      by showing that we can make <m>f(x,y)</m> as close to <m>0</m> as we wish by taking <m>(x,y)</m> sufficiently close (but not equal) to <m>(0,0)</m>. In what follows, we view <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as being real numbers that are close, but not equal, to 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>0 \leq x^2</m>, we have
      <me>
        y^2 \leq x^2+y^2,
      </me>
      which implies that
      <me>
        \frac{y^2}{x^2+y^2} \leq 1.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Multiplying both sides by <m>x^2</m> and observing that <m>f(x,y) \ge 0</m> for all <m>(x,y)</m> gives
      <me>
        0\leq f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2} =
        x^2\left(\frac{y^2}{x^2+y^2}\right) \leq x^2.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, <m> 0 \leq f(x,y) \leq x^2</m>. Since <m>x^2 \to 0</m> as <m>x \to 0</m>, we can make <m>f(x,y)</m> as close to <m>0</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>0</m> (for this example, it turns out that we don't even need to worry about making <m>y</m> close to 0). Therefore,
      <me>
        \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2} = 0.
      </me>

    </example>

    <p>
      In spite of the fact that these two most recent examples
      illustrate some of the complications that arise when studying limits of two-variable functions, many of the properties that are familiar from our study of single variable functions hold in precisely the same way.

      We can use these properties and results from single variable calculus to verify that many limits exist. For example, these properties show that the function <m>f</m>

        f(x,y) = 3x^2y^3 + 2xy^2 - 3x + 1

      has a limit at every point <m>(a,b)</m> and, moreover,
      <me>
        \lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = f(a,b).
      </me>

    <p>
      The reason for this is that polynomial functions of a single variable have limits at every point.

    <title>Continuity</title>
    <p>
      Recall that a function <m>f</m> of a single variable <m>x</m> is said to be
      continuous at
      <m>x=a</m> provided that the following three conditions are satisfied:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(a)</m> exists,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(x)</m> exists, and
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using our understanding of limits of multivariable functions, we can
      define continuity in the same way.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f=f(x,y)</m>
          is <term>continuous</term><idx><h>continuity</h></idx> at the point <m>(a,
              b)</m> provided that
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f</m> is defined at the point <m>(a, b)</m>,
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y)</m> exists, and
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y) = f(a,b)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For instance, we have seen that the function <m>f</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = 3x^2y^3 + 2xy^2
      - 3x + 1</m> is continous at every point. And just as with single variable functions, continuity has certain
      properties that are based on the properties of limits.
    </p>

      <title>Properties of continuity</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be functions of two variables that are continuous at the point <m>(a,b)</m>. Then
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>cf</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m> for any scalar <m>c</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f+g</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f-g</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>fg</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\frac{f}{g}</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m> if <m>g(a,b) \neq 0</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    </assemblage>


    
    <p>
      Using these properties, we can apply results from single variable calculus
      to decide about continuity of multivariable functions. For example, the coordinate functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = x</m> and <m>g(x,y) = y</m> are continuous at every point. We can then use properties of continuity listed to conclude that every polynomial function in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is continuous at every point. For example, <m>g(x,y)=x^2</m> and <m>h(x,y)=y^3</m> are continuous functions, so their product <m>f(x,y) = x^2y^3</m> is a continuous multivariable function.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> has a limit <m>L</m> at a point <m>(a,b)</m> provided that we
            can make <m>f(x,y)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>(x,y)</m>
            sufficiently close (but not equal) to <m>(a,b)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>(x,y)</m> has two different limits as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches
            <m>(a,b)</m> along two different paths, we can conclude that
            <m>\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y)</m> does not exist.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Properties similar to those for one-variable functions allow us
            to conclude that many limits exist and to evaluate them.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> is continuous at a point <m>(a,b)</m> in its
            domain if <m>f</m> has a limit at <m>(a,b)</m> and
          <me>
            f(a,b) = \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y).
