        <title>Features of the Text</title>
        <p>
    Similar to the presentation of the single-variable <em>Active Calculus</em>, instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation, including:
    <dl><li>
      <title>Motivating Questions.</title>
        <p>
          At the start of each section, we list <em>motivating questions</em> that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us.  One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <title>Preview Activities.</title>
        <p>
          Each section of the text begins with a short introduction, followed by a <em>preview activity</em>.  This brief reading and the preview activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section; both the reading and preview activity are intended to be accessible to students <em>in advance</em> of class, and indeed to be completed by students before a day on which a particular section is to be considered.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <title>Activities.</title>
        <p>
          Every section in the text contains several <em>activities</em>.  These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key examples on their own, working either individually or in small groups.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <title>Exercises.</title>
        <p>
          There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises.  Rather than repeat a large list of standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of <webwork/> with its access to the National Problem Library and its many multivariable calculus problems. In this text, each section begins with several anonymous <webwork/> exercises, and follows with several  challenging problems. The <webwork/> exercises are best completed in <url href="https://activecalculus.org/multi/"><c>the .html version of the text</c></url>. Almost every non-<webwork/> problem has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings.  For instructors interested in a more conventional source of exercises, consider the freely available <url href="www.apexcalculus.com"><c>APEX Calculus</c></url> text by Greg Hartmann et al.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <title>Graphics.</title>
        <p>
          As much as possible, we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually, and to encourage students to do the same.  Throughout the text, we use full-color graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus. When the text itself refers to color in images, one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically. The figures and the software to generate them have been created by David Austin.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <title>Summary of Key Ideas.</title>
        <p>
          Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <title>Links to technological tools.</title>
        <p>
          Many of the ideas of multivariable calculus are best understood dynamically, and we encourage readers to make frequent use of technology to analyze graphs and data. Since technology changes so often, we refrain from indicating specific programs to use in the text. However, aside from computer algebra systems like <em>Maple</em>, <em>Mathematics</em>, or <em>Sage</em>, there are many free graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces or curves. These programs can be used by instructors and students to assist in the investigations and demonstrations. The use of these freely available applets is in accord with our philosophy that no one should be required to purchase materials to learn calculus. We are indebted to everyone who allows their expertise to be openly shared. Below is a list of a few of the technological tools that are available (links active at the writing of this edition). Of course, you can find your own by searching the web.

        <title>Active Calculus - Multivariable: our goals</title>
        <p>
    Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus rests. As a body of knowledge, calculus has been completely understood for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.
  </p>
        <p>
    While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas an author presents are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century<mdash/>an age where the internet permits seamless and immediate transmission of information<mdash/>no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a main purpose of this work is to present a new multivariable calculus text that is <em>free</em>. In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is <em>open-source</em>. 
  </p>
        <p>
    In <em>Active Calculus - Multivariable</em>, we endeavor to actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are completed by students. Where many texts present a general theory of calculus followed by substantial collections of worked examples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples, the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties, followed by formal statements of rules or theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results, rarely do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to <em>demonstrate</em> to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for students to <em>encounter</em> these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to understand for themselves why calculus is both coherent and true.
  </p>
        <p>
    This approach is consistent with the following goals:
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners strive to construct solutions and approaches to ideas on their own, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in multivariable calculus are natural and true.  We strive to accomplish this by using specific cases to highlight the ideas for the general situation using contexts that are common and familiar.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of multivariable calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, through working on activities in small groups in class, and through doing substantial exercises outside of class time.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          To strengthen students' written and oral communication skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of multivariable calculus.

        <title>How to Use this Text</title>
        <p>
      Because the text is free, any professor or student may use the electronic version of the text for no charge. For reading on laptops or mobile devices, the best electronic version to use is <url href="https://activecalculus.org/multi/"><c>the .html version of the text</c></url>, but you can find links to a pdf and hard copy of the text at <url href="https://activecalculus.org/"><c>https://activecalculus.org/</c></url>. Furthermore, because the text is open-source, any instructor may acquire the full set of source files, which are <url href="https://github.com/StevenSchlicker/AC3PreTeXt/tree/master/src"> available on GitHub</url>.
    </p>
        <p>
      This text may be used as a stand-alone textbook for a standard multivariable calculus course or as a supplement to a more traditional text. <xref ref="C-9">Chapter</xref> introduces functions of several independent variables along with tools that will be used to study these functions, namely vectors and vector-valued functions. <xref ref="C-10">Chapter</xref> studies differentiation of functions of several independent variables in detail, addressing the typical topics including limits, partial derivatives, and optimization, while <xref ref="C-11">Chapter</xref> provides the standard topics of integration of multivariable functions. 
    </p>
        <p>
      <dl width="narrow"><li>
        <title>Electronic Edition</title>
          <p>
            Because students and instructors alike have access to the book in electronic format, there are several advantages to the text over a traditional print text. One is that the text may be projected on a screen in the classroom (or even better, on a whiteboard) and the instructor may reference ideas in the text directly, add comments or notation or features to graphs, and indeed write right on the projected text itself. Students can do the same when working at the board. In addition, students can choose to print only whatever portions of the text are needed for them.
            Also, the electronic versions of the text includes live .html links to on-line programs, so student and instructor alike may follow those links to additional resources that lie outside the text itself. Finally, students can have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have a computer. The .html version is far superior to the .pdf version; this is especially true for viewing on a smartphone.
          </p>

           <p>
            <em>Note.</em> In the .pdf version, there is not an obvious visual indicator of the live .html links, so some availalable information is suppressed. If you are using the text electronically in a setting with internet access, please know that it is assumed you are using the .html version.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Activities Workbook</title>
            <p>
              Each section of the text has a preview activity and at least three in-class activities embedded in the discussion. As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves. A separate workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity prompts, along with space provided for students to write their responses, is in development. 
          </p>
        </li><li>
        <title>Community of Users</title>
          <p>
            Because this text is free and open-source, we hope that as people use the text, they will contribute corrections, suggestions, and new material. At this time, the best way to communicate such feedback is by email to Steve Schlicker at <c>schlicks@gvsu.edu</c>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
      Throughout our mathematical careers we have studied functions of a
      single variable. We define a function of one variable as a rule that
      assigns exactly one output to each input. We analyze these functions
      by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating,
      integrating, and more. Functions of several variables will be the main focus of Chapters 10 and 11, where we will analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. We will see that many of the ideas from single variable calculus translate well to functions of several variables, but we will have to make some adjustments as well. In this chapter we introduce functions of several variables and then discuss some of the tools (vectors and vector-valued functions) that will help us understand and analyze functions of several variables.

      Up to this point we have been concerned with functions of a single variable. What defined such a function is that every input in the domain produced a unique output in the range. We saw similar behavior in <xref ref="PA-9-1">Preview Activity</xref>, where each pair <m>(P,t)</m> of inputs produces a unique output <m>A(P,t)</m>. Additionally, the two variables <m>P</m> and <m>t</m> had no real relation to each other. That is, we could choose any value of <m>P</m> without considering what value <m>t</m> might have, and we could select any value of <m>t</m> to use without regard to what value <m>P</m> might have. For that reason we say that the variables <m>t</m> and <m>P</m> are <em>independent</em> of each other. Thus, we call <m>A = A(P,t)</m> a function of the two independent variables <m>P</m> and <m>t</m>. This is the key idea in defining a function of two independent variables.

      There is, of course, no reason to restrict ourselves to functions of
      only two variables<mdash/>we can use any number of variables we like. For
      example,
      <me>
        f(x,y,z) = x^2 - 2xz + \cos(y)
      </me>
      defines <m>f</m> as a function of the
      three variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>. In general, a function of <m>n</m>
      independent variables is a rule that assigns to an ordered <m>n</m>-tuple
      <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)</m> in some set <m>D</m> exactly one real number.
    </p>
          <p>
      As with functions of a single variable, it is important to understand

          <title>Representing Functions of Two Variables</title>
          <p>
      One of the techniques we use to study functions of one
      variable is to create a table of values. We can do the same for
      functions of two variables, except that our tables will have to allow
      us to keep track of both input variables. We can do this with a
      2-dimensional table, where we list the <m>x</m>-values down the first column
      and the <m>y</m>-values across the first row. 

      As an example, suppose we launch a projectile, using a golf club, a cannon, or some other device, from ground level. Under ideal conditions (ignoring wind resistance, spin, or any other forces except the force of gravity) the
      horizontal distance the object will travel depends on the initial
      velocity <m>x</m> the object is given, and the angle <m>y</m> at which it is
      launched. If we let <m>f</m> represent the horizontal distance the object
      travels, then <m>f</m> is a function of the two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and we represent <m>f</m> in functional notation by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{g},
      </me>
      where <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity. (Note that <m>g</m> is constant, 32 feet per second squared. We will derive this equation in a later section.)
      To create a table of values for <m>f</m>, we list the <m>x</m>-values down the first column and the <m>y</m>-values across the first row. The value <m>f(x,y)</m> is then displayed in the location where the <m>x</m> row intersects the <m>y</m> column, as shown in <xref ref="T-9-1-range">Table</xref> (where we measure <m>x</m> in feet per second and <m>y</m> in radians).
    </p>
          <table xml:id="T-9-1-range">

      We also often refer to the graph of a function <m>f</m> of two variables as
      the <em>surface</em><idx><h>function</h><h>surface</h></idx> generated by <m>f</m>. Points in
      the form <m>(x,y,f(x,y))</m> are in three dimensions, so plotting these
      points takes a bit more work than graphs of functions in two
      dimensions. To plot these three-dimensional points, we need to set up
      a coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes <mdash/> the
      <m>x</m>-axis, the <m>y</m>-axis, and the <m>z</m>-axis (called the <em>coordinate
      axes</em>). There are essentially two different ways we could set up a
      3D coordinate system, as shown in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand">Figure</xref>; thus, before we can proceed, we need to establish a convention.
    </p>

          <p>
      The distinction between these two figures is subtle, but important. In the coordinate system shown at left in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand">Figure</xref>, imagine that you are sitting on the positive <m>z</m>-axis next to the label <q><m>z</m>.</q> Looking down at the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes, you see that the <m>y</m>-axis is obtained by rotating the <m>x</m>-axis by 90<m>^\circ</m> in the <em>clockwise</em> direction. Again sitting on the positive <m>z</m>-axis in the coordinate system at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand">Figure</xref>, you see that the <m>y</m>-axis is obtained by rotating the <m>x</m>-axis by 90<m>^\circ</m> in the <em>counterclockwise</em>
      direction.
    </p>
          <p>
      We call the coordinate system at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-left-right-hand"/> a <em>right-hand system</em>; if we point the index finger of our <em>right</em>
      hand along the positive <m>x</m>-axis and our middle finger along the
      positive <m>y</m>-axis, then our thumb points in the direction of the
      positive <m>z</m>-axis. Following mathematical conventions, we choose to
      use a right-hand system throughout this book.
    </p>
          <p>
      Now that we have established a convention for a right-hand system, we can draw a graph of the distance function defined by <m>f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}</m>. Note that the function <m>f</m> is continuous in both variables, so when we plot these points in the right hand coordinate system, we can connect them all to form a surface in 3-space. The graph of the distance function <m>f</m> is shown in <xref ref="F-9-1-range">Figure</xref>.

      There are many graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces as indicated in the Preface (see Links to interactive graphics in Features of the Text). Since we will be able to visualize graphs of functions of two independent variables, but not functions of more than two variables, we will primarily deal with functions of two variables in this text. It is important to note, however, that the techniques we develop apply to functions of any number of variables.

      In addition to graphing functions, we will also want to understand
      graphs of some simple equations in three dimensions. For example, in
      <m>\R^2</m>, the graphs of the equations <m>x=a</m> and <m>y=b</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
      are constants, are lines parallel to the coordinate axes. In the next
      activity we consider their three-dimensional analogs.

          <p>
      When we study functions of several variables we are often interested
      in how each individual variable affects the function in and of
      itself. In <xref ref="PA-9-1">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw that the amount of money in an account depends on the interest rate and the
      duration of the investment. However, if we fix the interest rate, the
      amount of money in the account depends only on the duration of the investment, and if we set the duration of the investment constant, then the amount of money in the account depends only on the interest rate. This
      idea of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to
      change will be an important tool for us when studying functions of
      several variables.
    </p>
          <p>
      As another example, consider again the distance function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}
      </me>
      where <m>x</m> is the initial velocity of an object in feet per second, <m>y</m> is the launch angle in radians, and <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity (32 feet per second squared). If we hold the launch angle constant at <m>y=0.6</m> radians, we can consider <m>f</m> a function of the initial velocity alone. In this case we have
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{x^2}{32}\sin(2\cdot 0.6).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      We can plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the
      surface when <m>y = 0.6</m>, as shown at left in <xref ref="F-9-1-trace1">Figure</xref>. The formula clearly shows that <m>f</m> is quadratic in the <m>x</m>-direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch velocity while keeping the launch angle constant, the horizontal distance the object travels increases proportional to the square of the initial velocity.
    </p>
          <p>
      Similarly, if we fix the initial velocity at 150 feet per second, we
      can consider the distance as a function of the launch angle only. In this
      case we have
      <me>
        f(y) = \frac{150^2 \sin(2y)}{32}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      We can again plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when <m>x=150</m>, as shown at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-trace1">Figure</xref>. The formula clearly show that <m>f</m> is sinusoidal in the <m>y</m>-direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch angle while keeping the initial velocity constant, the horizontal distance traveled by the object is proportional to the sine of twice the launch
      angle.

The contours also depict changes in altitude: contours that are close together signify steep ascents or descents, while contours that are far apart indicate only slight changes in elevation. Thus, contour maps tell us a lot about three-dimensional surfaces. Mathematically, if <m>f(x,y)</m> represents the altitude at the point <m>(x,y)</m>, then each contour is the graph of an equation of the form <m>f(x,y) = k</m>, for some constant <m>k</m>.

For example, level curves of the distance function defined by <m>f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{32}</m> plotted in the <m>xy</m>-plane are shown at left in <xref ref="F-9-1-contours-1">Figure</xref>. If we lift these contours and plot them at their respective heights, then we get a picture of the surface itself, as illustrated at right in <xref ref="F-9-1-contours-1">Figure</xref>.

      The traces and level curves of a function of two variables are curves
      in space. In order to understand these traces and level curves better,
      we will first spend some time learning about vectors and vector-valued
      functions in the next few sections and return to our study of
      functions of several variables once we have those more mathematical
      tools to support their study.

          <ul>
            <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of several variables is a rule that assigns a unique number to an ordered collection of independent inputs.  The domain of a function of several variables is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          In <m>\R^3</m>, the distance between points <m>P=(x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> and <m>Q=(x_1, y_1, z_1)</m> (denoted as <m>|PQ|</m>)  is given by the formula
          <me>
            |PQ| = \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2 + (z_1-z_0)^2}.
          </me>
          and thus the equation of a sphere with center <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> and radius <m>r</m> is
          <me>
            (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          A trace of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>z = f(c,y)</m> or <m>z = f(x,c)</m>, where <m>c</m> is a constant. A trace tells us how the function depends on a single independent variable if we treat the other independent variable as a constant.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          A level curve of a function <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is a curve of the form <m>k = f(x,y)</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant. A level curve describes the set of inputs that lead to a specific output of the function.

      <solution>




      Substitute <m>(x,y) = \left(-1,3\right)</m> to find 
      <m>f(-1,3) = -1  + 3(-1)^{4} = 2</m>.



      Similarly, with <m>(x,y) = \left(-4,2\right)</m> we find 
      <m>f(-4,2) = -4  + 2(-4)^{4} = 508</m>.



      Finally, for <m>(x,y) = \left(-1,-3\right)</m> we find 
      <m>f(-1,-3) = -1   - 3(-1)^{4} = -4</m>.

       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      Holding <m>x</m> fixed at 2 means that we are considering an injection of
      2 mg of the drug; letting <m>t</m> vary means we are watching the effect of
      this dose as time passes. Thus the function <m>f(2,t)</m> describes the
      concentration of the drug in the blood resulting from a 2 mg injection
      as a function of time. The figure below shows the graph of
      <m>f(2,t)=t\,e^{-3 t}</m>. Notice that the concentration in the blood from
      this dose is at a maximum at 0.333333 hour after injection, and that the
      concentration in the blood eventually approaches zero.  The initial
      concentration is 0, so the minimum occurs at <m>t = 0</m>.




      <sidebyside widths="33.3333333333333%"><image source="images/webwork-16-image-1.png"/></sidebyside><alert>(b)</alert>
      Holding <m>t</m> fixed at 2.5 means that we are focusing on the blood 2.5 hours
      after the injection; letting <m>x</m> vary means we are considering the
      effect of different doses at that instant. Thus, the function <m>f(x,2.5)</m>
      gives the concentration of the drug in the blood 2.5 hours after
      injection as a function of the amount injected. The figure below
      shows the graph of <m>f(x,2.5)=2.5 e^{-(5-x)}</m>. Notice that <m>f(x,2.5)</m> is
      an increasing function of <m>x</m>. This makes sense: If we administer more of
      the drug, the concentration in the bloodstream is higher.  In particular,
      this means that the maximum concentration occurs at the maximum value of
      <m>x</m>, 4, and the minimum at <m>x = 0</m>.

        When people buy a large ticket item like a

        loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of
        the loan, plus interest, is paid. The monthly payment that the

        the interest rate <m>r</m>. For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy a car, the monthly payment <m>M</m> that we need to make to pay off the loan is given by the formula

      Quantities like length, speed, area, and mass are all measured by numbers (called <em>scalars</em>). Other quantities, like velocity, force, and displacement, have two attributes: magnitude and direction. These quantities are represented by <em>vectors</em> and are the study of this section. For example, we will use vectors to calculate work done by a constant force, calculate torque, determine direction vectors for lines and normal vectors for planes, define curvature, and determine the direction of greatest increase on a surface. For most of these applications, we will be interested in using vectors to measure direction and/or speed.  Vectors will be a major tool for us in determining the behavior of functions of several variables. 
    </p>
          <p>
      If we are at a point <m>x</m> in the domain of a function of one variable,
      there are only two directions in which we can move: in the positive or
      negative <m>x</m>-direction. If, however, we are at a point <m>(x,y)</m> in the domain of a function of two variables, there are many directions in which we can move. Thus, it is important for us to have a means to indicate direction, and we will do so using vectors. This notion of direction in space will be critical for us to find direction vectors for lines, tangent lines to curves, normal vectors to planes, and to determine direction of motion.

        Postscript is a programming language whose primary purpose is to describe the appearance of text or graphics. A simple set of Postscript commands that produces the triangle in the plane with vertices <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(1,1)</m>, and <m>(1,-1)</m> is the following:

          <cd> 
          (0,0) moveto 
          (1,1) lineto stroke
          (1,-1) lineto stroke
          (0,0) lineto stroke
          </cd>

        The key idea in these commands is that we start at the origin, then tell Postscript that we want to start at the point <m>(0,0)</m>, draw a line from the point <m>(0,0)</m> to the point <m>(1,1)</m> (this is what the lineto and stroke commands do), then draw lines from <m>(1,1)</m> to <m>(1,-1)</m> and <m>(1,-1)</m> back to the origin. Each of these commands encodes two important pieces of information: a direction in which to move and a distance to move. Mathematically, we can capture this information succinctly in a vector. To do so, we record the movement on the map in a pair <m>\langle x, y \rangle</m> (this pair <m>\langle x, y \rangle</m> is a <term>vector</term>), where <m>x</m> is the horizontal displacement and <m>y</m> the vertical displacement from one point to another. So, for example, the vector from the origin to the point <m>(1,1)</m> is represented by the vector <m>\langle 1,1 \rangle</m>.

          <title>Representations of Vectors</title>
          <p>
      <xref ref="PA-9-2">Preview Activity</xref> shows how we can record the magnitude
      and direction of a change in position using an ordered pair of numbers
      <m>\langle x,y\rangle</m>. There are many other quantities, such as force
      and velocity, that possess the attributes of magnitude and direction,
      and we will call each such quantity a <em>vector</em>.
    </p>
          <definition>
            <statement>
              <p>
          A
          <term>vector</term><idx><h>vector</h><h>definition</h></idx> is a quantity that possesses the attributes of magnitude and
          direction.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
      We can represent a vector geometrically as a directed line segment,
      with the magnitude as the length of the segment and an arrowhead
      indicating direction, as shown at left in <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors-single">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F-9-2-vectors-single">
            <caption>Left: A vector. Right: Representations of the same vector.</caption>

              <image source="images/fig_9_2_multiple"/>
            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      According to the definition, a vector possesses the attributes of length (magnitude) and direction; the vector's position, however, is not mentioned. Consequently, we regard as equal any two vectors having the same magnitude and direction, as shown at right in <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors-single">Figure</xref>. In other words, two vectors are <term>equal</term> provided they have the same magnitude and direction.
    </p>
          <p>
      This means that the same vector may be drawn in the plane in many different ways. For instance, suppose that we would like to draw the vector <m>\langle 3, 4\rangle</m>, which
      represents a horizontal change of three units and a vertical change of four units. We may place the <em>tail</em> of the vector (the point from which the vector originates) at the origin and the <em>tip</em> (the terminal point of the vector) at <m>(3,4)</m>, as illustrated at left in <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors-standard">Figure</xref>. A vector with its tail at the origin is said to be in <em>standard position</em>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F-9-2-vectors-standard">
            <caption>Left: Standard position. Right: A vector between two points.</caption>
            <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
              <image source="images/fig_9_2_std_pos"/>
              <image source="images/fig_9_2_btw_pts"/>
            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      Alternatively, we may place the tail of the vector <m>\langle 3,4\rangle</m> at another point, such as <m>Q(1,1)</m>. After a displacement of three units to the right and four units up, the tip of the vector is at the point <m>R(4,5)</m> (see the vector at right in 
      <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors-standard">Figure</xref>).
    </p>
          <p>
      In this example, the vector led to the directed line segment from <m>Q</m>
      to <m>R</m>, which we denote as <m>\overrightarrow{QR}</m>. We may also
      turn the situation around: given the two points <m>Q</m> and <m>R</m>, we obtain
      the vector <m>\langle 3,4\rangle</m> because we move horizontally three
      units and vertically four units to get from <m>Q</m> to <m>R</m>. In other
      words, <m>\overrightarrow{QR} = \langle 3,4\rangle</m>. In general, the
      vector <m>\overrightarrow{QR}</m> from the point <m>Q = (q_1, q_2)</m> to <m>R = (r_1,
      r_2)</m> is found by taking the difference of coordinates, so that
      <me>
        \overrightarrow{QR} = \langle r_1-q_1, r_2-q_2 \rangle.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      We will use boldface letters to represent vectors, such
      as <m>\vv = \langle 3, 4 \rangle</m>, to distinguish them from scalars. The
      entries of a vector are called its <em>components</em>; in the vector
      <m>\langle 3, 4 \rangle</m>, the <m>x</m> component is 3 and the <m>y</m>
      component is 4. We use pointed brackets <m>\langle \ , \rangle</m> and the term
      <em>components</em> to distinguish a vector from a point <m>( \ , )</m> and
      its <em>coordinates</em>. There is, however, a close connection between vectors
      and points. Given a point <m>P</m>, we will frequently consider the vector
      <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> from the origin <m>O</m> to <m>P</m>. For instance, if
      <m>P=(3,4)</m>, then <m>\overrightarrow{OP}=\langle 3,4\rangle</m> as in <xref ref="F-9-2-vectors4">Figure</xref>.
      In this way, we think of a point <m>P</m> as defining a vector
      <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> whose components agree with the coordinates of
      <m>P</m>. The vector <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> is called the <em>position vector</em><idx><h>position vector</h></idx> of <m>P</m>. 
    </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
      While we often illustrate vectors in the plane since it is easier
      to draw pictures, different situations call for the use of vectors
      in three or more dimensions. For instance, a
      vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>n</m>-dimensional space, <m>\R^n</m>, has <m>n</m>
      components and may be represented as
      <me>
        \vv = \langle v_1, v_2, v_3,  \ldots, v_n \rangle.
      </me>

      operations on vectors in three dimensions.

        An article by C.Kenneth Tanner of the University of Georgia argues that, due to the concept of social distance, a secondary school classroom for 20 students should have 1344 square feet of floor space.

          <title>Equality of Vectors</title>
          <p>
      Because location is not mentioned in the
      definition of a vector, any two vectors that have the same
      magnitude and direction are equal. It is helpful to have an
      algebraic way to determine when this occurs. That is, if we know the
      components of two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, we will want to be able to determine algebraically when <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are equal. There is an obvious set of conditions that we use.

          <title>Operations on Vectors</title>
          <p>
      Vectors are not numbers, but we can now represent them with components
      that are real numbers. As such, we naturally wonder if it is possible
      to add two vectors together, multiply two vectors, or combine vectors
      in any other ways. In this section, we will study two
      operations on vectors: vector addition and scalar multiplication. To
      begin, we investigate a natural way to add two vectors together, as
      well as to multiply a vector by a scalar.

      We can now add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars, and thus we
      can add together scalar multiples of vectors. This allows us to define
      <em>vector subtraction</em><idx><h>vector</h><h>subtraction</h></idx>, <m>\vv - \vu</m>, as
      the sum of <m>\vv</m> and <m>-1</m> times <m>\vu</m>, so that

        \vv - \vu = \vv + (-1)\vu.
      </me>

          <p>
      Using vector addition and scalar multiplication, we will often
      represent vectors in terms of the special vectors <m>\vi =
      \langle 1, 0 \rangle</m> and <m>\vj = \langle 0,1 \rangle</m>. For instance,
      we can write
      the vector <m>\langle a, b \rangle</m> in <m>\R^2</m> as
      <me>
        \langle a, b \rangle = a\langle 1, 0 \rangle + b\langle 0, 1 \rangle = a\vi + b \vj,
      </me>
      which means that
      <me>
        \langle 2, -3 \rangle = 2\vi - 3\vj.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      In the context of <m>\R^3</m>, we let <m>\vi = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle</m>, <m>\vj = \langle 0,1,0 \rangle</m>, and <m>\vk = \langle 0,0,1 \rangle</m>, and we can write the vector <m>\langle a, b, c \rangle</m> in <m>\R^3</m> as
      <me>
        \langle a, b,c \rangle = a\langle 1, 0,0 \rangle + b\langle 0, 1,0 \rangle + c\langle 0,0,1 \rangle = a\vi + b \vj + c\vk.

          <p>
      The vectors <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m> are called the <em>standard unit vectors</em> (as we will learn momentarily, unit vectors have length 1), and are important in the physical sciences.

      We know that the scalar sum <m>1+2</m> is equal to the scalar sum
      <m>2+1</m>. This is called the <em>commutative</em> property of scalar
      addition. Any time we define operations on objects (like addition of
      vectors) we usually want to know what kinds of properties the
      operations have. For example, is addition of vectors a commutative
      operation? To answer this question we take two <em>arbitrary</em>
      vectors <m>\vv</m> and <m>\vu</m> and add them together and see what
      happens. Let <m>\vv = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle</m> and <m>\vu = \langle u_1,
      u_2 \rangle</m>. Now we use the fact that <m>v_1</m>, <m>v_2</m>, <m>u_1</m>, and <m>u_2</m>
      are scalars, and that the addition of scalars is commutative to see
      that
      <md><mrow>\vv + \vu  =\mathstrut \amp  \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle + \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</mrow><mrow> =\mathstrut \amp  \langle v_1+u_1, v_2 + u_2 \rangle </mrow><mrow> =\mathstrut \amp  \langle u_1+v_1, u_2+v_2 \rangle </mrow><mrow> =\mathstrut \amp  \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle + \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle </mrow><mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \vu + \vv.</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      So the vector sum is a commutative operation. Similar arguments can be
      used to show the following properties of vector addition and scalar
      multiplication.

          <title>Geometric Interpretation of Vector Operations</title>
          <p>
      Next, we explore a geometric interpretation of vector addition and
      scalar multiplication that allows us to visualize these operations.
      Let <m>\vu = \langle 4, 6 \rangle</m> and <m>\vv = \langle 3, -2
      \rangle</m>. Then <m>\vw = \vu + \vv = \langle 7, 4 \rangle</m>, as shown on the left in
      <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F-9-2-vector-sum">
            <caption>A vector sum (left), summing displacements (center), the parallelogram law (right).</caption>
            <image width="100%" source="images/fig_9_2_operations"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      If we think of these vectors as displacements in the plane, we
      find a geometric way to envision vector addition. For instance, the
      vector <m>\vu + \vv</m> will represent the displacement obtained by
      following the displacement <m>\vu</m> with the displacement <m>\vv</m>. We may
      picture this by placing the tail of <m>\vv</m> at the tip of <m>\vu</m>, as seen
      in the center of <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Of course, vector addition is commutative so we obtain the same sum if we place the tail of <m>\vu</m> at the tip of <m>\vv</m>. We therefore see that <m>\vu+\vv</m> appears as the diagonal of the parallelogram<idx><h>vector</h><h>sum, parallelogram</h></idx> determined by <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, as shown at right in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Vector subtraction has a similar interpretation. At left in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-addition">Figure</xref> we see vectors <m>\vu</m>, <m>\vv</m>, and <m>\vw =\vu + \vv</m>. If we rewrite <m>\vv = \vw - \vu</m>, we have the arrangement shown at right in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-addition">Figure</xref>. In other words, to form the difference <m>\vw-\vu</m>, we draw a vector from the tip of <m>\vu</m> to the tip of <m>\vw</m>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F-9-2-vector-addition">
            <caption>Left: Vector addition. Right: Vector subtraction.</caption>

              <image source="images/fig_9_2_subtraction"/>
            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      In a similar way, we may geometrically represent a scalar multiple of a
      vector. For instance, if <m>\vv=\langle 2,3\rangle</m>, then
      <m>2\vv = \langle 4,6\rangle</m>. As shown in <xref ref="F-9-2-vector-sum7">Figure</xref>, multiplying <m>\vv</m> by 2 leaves the direction
      unchanged, but stretches <m>\vv</m> by 2. Also, <m>-2\vv = \langle -4,
      -6\rangle</m>, which shows that multiplying by a negative scalar gives a
      vector pointing in the opposite direction of <m>\vv</m>.

          <title>The Magnitude of a Vector</title>
          <p>
      By definition, vectors have both direction and magnitude (or length). We now investigate how to calculate the magnitude of a vector. Since a vector <m>\vv</m> can be represented
      by a directed line segment, we can use the distance formula to calculate the length of the segment. This length is the <em>magnitude</em> of the vector <m>\vv</m> and is denoted <m>|\vv|</m>.

          A vector is an object that possesses the attributes of

          Two vectors are equal if they have the

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      The components are 
      <m>v_1 = 5 \cos \pi/4 = (5)({1\over\sqrt 2}) = {5 \over\sqrt 2}</m>
      and
      <m>v_2 = 5 \sin \pi/4 = (5)({1\over\sqrt 2}) = {5 \over\sqrt 2}</m>.
      Thus
      <m>\vec v = {5 \over\sqrt 2}\,\vec i + {5 \over\sqrt 2}\,\vec j</m>.




      <alert>(b)</alert>
      Since the vector lies in the <m>xz</m>-plane, its <m>y</m>-component is 0.
      Its <m>x</m>-component is <m>(3)(\cos 2\pi/3) = -{3\over 2}</m>,
      and
      and its <m>z</m>-component is <m>(3)(\sin 2\pi/3) = {3\sqrt 3\over 2}</m>.
      So the vector is <m>\vec w = -{3\over 2}\,\vec i + {3\sqrt 3\over 2}\,\vec k</m>.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      Since the component of <m>\vec v</m> in the <m>\,\mathit{\vec i}</m>-direction
      is 5, we have
      <m>\vec v = 5 \,\mathit{\vec i} + b \,\mathit{\vec j}</m> for some <m>b</m>.  Since
      <m>||\vec v|| = 13</m>, we have 
      <m>\sqrt{5^2 + b^2} = 13^2</m>, so
      <m>b = 12</m> or <m>b = -12</m>.
      There are two vectors satisfying the properties given:
      <m>\vec v = 5\,\mathit{\vec i}+12\,\mathit{\vec j}, 5\,\mathit{\vec i}-12\,\mathit{\vec j}</m>.

       SOLUTION 



      We need to calculate the length of each vector to find the speeds of
      the two cars:
      <me>|| 26\vec i + 31\vec j || = \sqrt{26^2 + 31^2} = \sqrt{1637}
          \approx 40.46</me>
      and
      <me>|| 40\vec i || = \sqrt{40^2} = 40.</me>
      So the first car is faster.

            A force (like gravity) has both a magnitude and a direction. If two forces <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are applied to an object at the same point, the resultant force on the object is the vector sum of the two forces.

          <title>The Dot Product</title>
          <p>
      The definition of the dot product for vectors in <m>\R^2</m> given in <xref ref="PA_9_3">Preview Activity</xref> can be extended to vectors in <m>\R^n</m>. 

      <definition><statement><p>
          The <term>dot product</term><idx><h>dot product</h></idx> of vectors <m>\vu=\langle u_1, u_2,\ldots,u_n\rangle</m> and <m>\vv=\langle v_1, v_2,\ldots,v_n\rangle</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is the scalar 
          <me>
            \vu\cdot\vv = u_1v_1+u_2v_2 + \ldots + u_nv_n.
          </me>
        </p></statement></definition>

      (As we will see shortly, the dot product arises in physics to calculate the work done by a vector force in a given direction. It might be more natural to define the dot product in this context, but it is more convenient from a mathematical perspective to define the dot product algebraically and then view work as an application of this definition.)
    </p>
          <p>
      For instance, we find that
      <me>
        \langle 3, 0, 1 \rangle\cdot\langle -2, 1, 4\rangle = 3\cdot(-2) +
        0\cdot1 + 1\cdot4 = -6 + 0 + 4 = -2.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Notice that the resulting quantity is a scalar. Our work in Preview
      <xref ref="PA_9_3">Activity</xref> examined dot products of two-dimensional
      vectors.

      The dot product is a natural way to define a product of two vectors.
      In addition, it behaves in ways that are similar to the product of,
      say, real numbers.

      Let <m>\vu</m>, <m>\vv</m>, and <m>\vw</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>. Then

          </assemblage>
          <p>
        Moreover, the dot product gives us valuable geometric information
      about the vectors and their relative orientation. For instance, let's
      consider what happens when we dot a vector with itself:
      <me>
        \vu\cdot\vu = \langle u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n \rangle \cdot \langle u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n \rangle = 
        u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2 = |\vu|^2.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      In other words, the dot product of a vector with itself gives the
      square of the length of the vector: <m>\vu\cdot\vu=|\vu|^2</m>.
    </p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection>
          <title>The angle between vectors</title>
          <p>
      The dot product can help us understand the angle between two vectors. For instance, if we are given two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, there are two angles that these vectors create, as depicted at left in <xref ref="F_9_3_Angle_between">Figure</xref>. We will call <m>\theta</m>, the smaller of these angles, the <em>angle between these vectors</em><idx><h>vector</h><h>angle between</h></idx>. Notice that <m>\theta</m> lies between 0 and <m>\pi</m>.

    
      <figure xml:id="F_9_3_Angle_between"><caption>Left: The angle between <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>. Right: The triangle formed by <m>\vu</m>, <m>\vv</m>, and <m>\vu-\vv</m>. </caption><sidebyside widths="45% 45%"><image source="images/fig_9_3_angle_1"/><image source="images/fig_9_3_angle_2"/></sidebyside></figure>
    
  
    </p>
          <p>
      To determine this angle, we may apply the Law of Cosines to the triangle shown at right in <xref ref="F_9_3_Angle_between">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Using the fact that the dot product of a vector with itself gives us
      the square of its length, together with the properties of the dot product, we find:
      <md><mrow>|\vu-\vv|^2 =\mathstrut \amp  |\vu|^2 + |\vv|^2 - 2|\vu||\vv|\cos(\theta)</mrow><mrow>(\vu-\vv)\cdot(\vu-\vv) =\mathstrut \amp  \vu\cdot\vu + \vv\cdot\vv - 2|\vu||\vv|\cos(\theta)</mrow><mrow>\vu\cdot(\vu-\vv) - \vv\cdot(\vu-\vv)=\mathstrut \amp  \vu\cdot\vu + \vv\cdot\vv - 2|\vu||\vv|\cos(\theta)</mrow><mrow>\vu\cdot\vu - 2\vu\cdot\vv + \vv\cdot\vv =\mathstrut \amp  \vu\cdot\vu + \vv\cdot\vv - 2|\vu||\vv|\cos(\theta)</mrow><mrow>-2\vu\cdot\vv =\mathstrut \amp  -2|\vu||\vv|\cos(\theta)</mrow><mrow>\vu\cdot\vv =\mathstrut \amp  |\vu||\vv|\cos(\theta).</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      To summarize, we have the important relationship
      <men xml:id="E_9_3_dot_angle">
        \vu\cdot\vv = u_1v_1+u_2v_2 + \ldots + u_nv_n =
          |\vu||\vv|\cos(\theta).
      </men>
    </p>
          <p>
      It is sometimes useful to think of Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_9_3_dot_angle"/> as giving us an expression for
      the angle between two vectors:
      <me>
        \theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vu||\vv|}\right).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      The real beauty of this expression is this: the dot product is a very
      simple algebraic operation to perform yet it provides us with
      important geometric information <mdash/> namely the angle between the vectors <mdash/> that would be difficult to determine otherwise.

          <title>The Dot Product and Orthogonality</title>
          <p>
      When the angle between two vectors is a right angle, it is frequently
      the case that something important is happening. In this case, we say the
      vectors are <em>orthogonal</em>. For instance, orthogonality often plays
      a role in optimization problems; to determine the shortest path from a
      point in <m>\R^3</m> to a given plane, we move along a line orthogonal to
      the plane.
    </p>
          <p>
      As <xref ref="A_9_3_2_a">Activity</xref> indicates, the dot product
      provides a simple means to determine whether two vectors are
      orthogonal to one another. In this case,
      <m>\vu\cdot\vv=|\vu||\vv|\cos(\pi/2) = 0</m>, so we make the following important observation.
    </p>
          <assemblage xml:id="Dot-product-orthogonality">
            <title>The dot product and orthogonality</title>
            <p>
      Two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^n</m> are
      orthogonal <idx><h>vectors</h><h>orthogonal</h></idx> to each other
      if <m>\vu \cdot \vv = 0</m>.
    </p>
          </assemblage>
          <p>
      More generally, the sign of the dot product gives us useful
      information about the relative orientation of the vectors. If we remember that

    <md><mrow>\cos(\theta) \gt 0 \mathstrut \amp \ \ \ \text{ if } \theta \text{ is an acute angle,}</mrow><mrow>\cos(\theta) = 0 \mathstrut \amp \ \ \ \text{ if } \theta \text{ is a right angle, and}</mrow><mrow>\cos(\theta) \lt 0 \mathstrut \amp \ \ \ \text{ if } \theta \text{ is an obtuse angle,}</mrow></md>
      we see that for nonzero vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>,
    <md><mrow> \vu\cdot\vv \gt 0 \mathstrut \amp \ \ \ \text{ if } \theta \text{ is an acute angle,}</mrow><mrow> \vu\cdot\vv = 0 \mathstrut \amp \ \ \ \text{ if }

          <title>Work, Force, and Displacement</title>
          <p>
      In physics, work is a measure of the energy required to apply a force
      to an object through a displacement. For instance, <xref ref="F_9_3_Work">Figure</xref> shows a force <m>\vF</m> displacing an object from point
      <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m>. The displacement is then represented by the
      vector <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_9_3_Work">
            <caption>A force <m>\vF</m> displacing an object.</caption>
            <image width="50%" source="images/fig_9_3_work_1"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      It turns out that the work required to displace the object is
      <me>
        W = \vF\cdot\overrightarrow{AB} = |\vF||\overrightarrow{AB}|\cos(\theta).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      This means that the work is determined only by the magnitude of the
      force applied parallel to the displacement. Consequently, if we are
      given two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, we would like to write <m>\vu</m> as a
      sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to <m>\vv</m> and one of which
      is orthogonal to <m>\vv</m>. We take up this task after the next activity.

          <p>
      Suppose we are given two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> as shown at left in <xref ref="F_9_3_Projection_a">Figure</xref>. Motivated by our discussion of work, we would like to write <m>\vu</m> as a sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to <m>\vv</m> and one of which is orthogonal. That is, we would like to write
      <men xml:id="E_9_3_proj">
        \vu = \proj_{\vv}\vu + \proj_{\perp\vv}\vu,
      </men>
      where <m>\proj_{\vv}\vu</m> is parallel to <m>\vv</m> and <m>\proj_{\perp\vv}\vu</m>
      is orthogonal to <m>\vv</m>. We call the vector <m>\proj_{\vv}\vu</m> the
      <em>projection</em> of <m>\vu</m> onto <m>\vv</m><idx><h>vector</h><h>projection</h></idx>. Note that, as the diagram at right in <xref ref="F_9_3_Projection_a">Figure</xref> illustrates, it is also possible to create a projection even if the angle between the vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> exceeds <m>\frac\pi2</m>.

    </p>
          <p>
      To find the vector <m>\proj_{\vv} \vu</m>, we will dot both sides of Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_9_3_proj"/> with the vector <m>\vv</m>, to find that
      <md><mrow>\vu\cdot\vv=\mathstrut \amp  (\proj_{\vv}\vu + \proj_{\perp\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv</mrow><mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  (\proj_{\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv +
          (\proj_{\perp\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv</mrow><mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  (\proj_{\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv.</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      Notice that <m>(\proj_{\perp\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv = 0</m> since
      <m>\proj_{\perp\vv}\vu</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vv</m>. Also, <m>\proj_{\vv}\vu</m>
      must be a scalar multiple of <m>\vv</m> since it is parallel to <m>\vv</m>, so we
      will write <m>\proj_{\vv}\vu = s\vv</m>. It follows that
      <me>
        \vu\cdot\vv =(\proj_{\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv = s\vv\cdot\vv,
      </me>
      which means that
      <me>
        s = \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{\vv\cdot\vv}
      </me>
      and hence
      <me>
        \proj_{\vv}\vu = \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{\vv\cdot\vv}\vv =
        \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vv|^2}\vv
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      It is sometimes useful to write <m>\proj_{\vv}\vu</m> as a scalar times a
      unit vector in the direction of <m>\vv</m>. We call this scalar the
      <em>component of <m>\vu</m> along <m>\vv</m></em> and denote it as
      <m>\comp_{\vv}\vu</m>. We therefore have
      <me>
        \proj_{\vv}\vu = \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vv|^2}\vv =
        \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vv|} \frac{\vv}{|\vv|}=
        \comp_{\vv}\vu \frac{\vv}{|\vv|},
      </me>
      so that
      <me>
        \comp_{\vv}\vu = \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vv|}.
      </me>

      Let <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>. The
      component<idx><h>vector</h><h>component in the direction of</h></idx> of <m>\vu</m> in
      the direction of <m>\vv</m> is the scalar
      <me>
        \comp_{\vv} \vu = \frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{|\vv|},

      and the

      </me>
    </p>
          </assemblage>
          <p>
      Moreover, since
      <me>
        \vu = \proj_{\vv} \vu + \proj_{\perp \vv} \vu,
      </me>
      it follows that
      <me>
        \proj_{\perp \vv} \vu = \vu - \proj_{\vv} \vu.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      This shows that once we have computed <m>\proj_{\vv} \vu</m>, we can find
      <m>\proj_{\perp \vv} \vu</m> simply by calculating the difference of two
      known vectors.

          The dot product of two vectors in <m>\R^n</m>, <m>\vu = \langle u_1,

            <li>
        <p>
          The dot product is related to the length of a vector since

            <li>

          The dot product provides us with information about the angle
            between the vectors since
          <me>
            \vu\cdot\vv = |\vu| \ |\vv|\cos(\theta),

          where <m>\theta</m> is the angle

        <p>
          Two vectors are orthogonal if the angle between them

            When running a sprint, the racers may be aided or slowed by the wind. The wind assistance is a measure of the wind speed that is helping push the runners down the track. It is much easier to run a very fast race if the wind is blowing hard in the direction of the race. So that world records aren't dependent on the weather conditions, times are only recorded as record times if the wind aiding the runners is less than or equal to 2 meters per second. Wind speed for a race is recorded by a wind gauge that is set up close to the track. It is important to note, however, that weather is not always as cooperative as we might like. The wind does not always blow exactly in the direction of the track, so the gauge must account for the angle the wind makes with the track. Suppose a 4 mile per hour wind is blowing to aid runners by making a <m>38^{\circ}</m> angle with the race track. Determine if any times set during such a race would qualify as records.

            Molecular geometry is the geometry determined by arrangements of atoms in molecules. Molecular geometry includes measurements like bond angle, bond length, and torsional angles. These attributes influence several properties of molecules, such as reactivity, color, and polarity.

             As an example of the molecular geometry of a molecule, consider the methane <m>\text{CH}_4</m> molecule, as illustrated in <xref ref="F-9-3-methane">Figure</xref>. According to the Valence Shell Electron Repulsion (VSEPR) model, atoms that surround single different atoms do so in a way that positions them as far apart as possible. This means that the hydrogen atoms in the methane molecule arrange themselves at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. The <em>bond angle</em> for methane is the angle determined by two consecutive hydrogen atoms and the central carbon atom. To determine the bond angle for methane, we can place the center carbon atom at the point <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)</m> and the hydrogen atoms at the points <m>(0,0,0)</m>, <m>(1,1,0)</m>, <m>(1,0,1)</m>, and <m>(0,1,1)</m>. Find the bond angle for methane to the nearest tenth of a degree.

        <introduction>
          <p>
      The last two sections have introduced some basic algebraic operations
      on vectors<mdash/>addition, scalar multiplication, and the dot
      product<mdash/>with useful geometric interpretations. In
      this section, we will meet a final algebraic operation, the <em>cross
      product</em>, which again conveys important geometric information.
    </p>
          <p>
      To begin, we must emphasize that the cross product is only defined for
      vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^3</m>.
      Also, remember that we use a right-hand coordinate
      system, as described in <xref ref="S-9-1-Functions">Section</xref>. In
      particular, recall that the vectors <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m> are
      oriented as shown below in <xref ref="F_9_4_basis">Figure</xref>. Earlier, we
      noticed that if we point the index finger of our <em>right</em> hand in
      the direction of <m>\vi</m> and our middle finger in the direction of
      <m>\vj</m>, then our thumb points in the direction of <m>\vk</m>.

        The cross product of two vectors, <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, will itself be a
        <term>vector</term> denoted <m>\vu\times\vv</m>. The direction of
        <m>\vu\times\vv</m> is determined by the right-hand rule: if we point the
        index finger of our right hand in the direction of <m>\vu</m> and our
        middle finger in the direction of <m>\vv</m>, then our thumb points in
        the direction of <m>\vu\times\vv</m>.
        <ol label="a."><li>
            <p>
              We begin by defining the cross products using the vectors <m>\vi</m>,
                <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m>.  Referring to <xref ref="F_9_4_basis">Figure</xref>, explain
                why <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, <m>\vk</m> in that order form a right-hand system. We then define <m>\vi \times \vj</m> to be <m>\vk</m> <mdash/> that is <m>\vi\times\vj = \vk</m>.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Now explain why <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vk</m>, and <m>-\vj</m> in that order form a right-hand system. We then define <m>\vi \times \vk</m> to be <m>-\vj</m> <mdash/> that is  <m>\vi\times\vk=-\vj</m>.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Continuing in this way, complete the missing entries in <xref ref="T_9_4_cross_def">Table</xref>.

              <table xml:id="T_9_4_cross_def"><title>Table of cross products involving <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>, and <m>\vk</m>.</title><tabular><row><cell><m>\vi\times\vj = \vk</m></cell><cell>   </cell><cell>   </cell><cell><m>\vi\times\vk = -\vj</m></cell><cell>   </cell><cell>   </cell><cell><m>\vj\times\vk =</m></cell></row><row><cell/></row><row><cell><m>\vj\times\vi =</m></cell><cell>   </cell><cell>   </cell><cell><m>\vk\times\vi =</m></cell><cell>   </cell><cell>   </cell><cell><m>\vk\times\vj =</m></cell></row></tabular></table>

            <p>
              Up to this point, the products you have seen, such as the
                  product of real numbers and the dot product of vectors, have been
                  commutative, meaning that the product does not depend on the order
                  of the terms.  For instance, <m>2\cdot5 = 5\cdot 2</m>.  The table
                  above suggests, however, that the cross
                  product is <em>anti-commutative</em>: for any vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^3</m>,  <m>\vu\times\vv =
                  -\vv\times\vu</m>.  

                  If we consider the case when <m>\vu=\vv</m>, this shows that
                  <m>\vv\times\vv = -(\vv\times\vv)</m>.  What does this tell us about
                  <m>\vv\times\vv</m>;  in particular, what vector is unchanged by
                  scalar multiplication by <m>-1</m>?
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              It is not difficult to show that the cross product interacts with scalar multiplication and vector addition as one would expect: that is  
              <md><mrow>(c\vu) \times \vv =\mathstrut \amp  c(\vu \times \vv) </mrow><mrow>(\vu + \vv) \times\vw =\mathstrut \amp  (\vu\times\vw) + (\vv\times\vw)</mrow>. 
              </md>
              We can combine these properties to make cross product calculations a bit easier. For example,
              <md><mrow> (2\vi + \vj) \times \vk =\mathstrut \amp (2\vi \times \vk) + (\vj \times \vk) </mrow><mrow> =\mathstrut \amp  2(\vi \times \vk) +  (\vj \times \vk) </mrow><mrow> =\mathstrut \amp -2 \vj + \vi. </mrow></md>
              Using these properties along with <xref ref="T_9_4_cross_def">Table</xref>, find the cross product <m>\vu\times\vv</m> if
                  <m>\vu = 2\vi + 3\vj</m> and <m>\vv = -\vi + \vk</m>.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Verify that the cross product <m>\vu\times\vv</m> you just found in
                  part (e) is
                  orthogonal to both <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Consider the vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane as

      If, in addition, we assume the cross product behaves like we think a product should (e.g., the cross product distributes over vector addition), we can compute the cross product in terms of the components of general vectors to find a formula for the cross product. Doing so we see that

      (Like the dot product, the cross product arises in physical applications, e.g., torque, but it is more convenient mathematically to begin from an algebraic perspective.)
    </p>
          <p>
      The previous calculations lead us to define the cross product of vectors in <m>\R^3</m> as follows.

      <definition><statement><p>
          The <term>cross product</term><idx><h>cross product</h></idx> <m>\vu \times \vv</m> of vectors <m>\vu = u_1\vi + u_2\vj + u_3\vk</m> and <m>\vv = v_1\vi + v_2\vj + v_3\vk</m> in <m>\R^3</m> is the vector

          <p>
      At first, this may look intimidating and difficult to remember. However, if we rewrite the expression in Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_9_4_cross_def"/> using determinants,
      important structure emerges. The determinant of a <m>2\times2</m> matrix is
      <me>
        \left|
          \begin{array}{cc}
            a \amp  b \\

          <title>The Length of <m>\vu\times\vv</m></title>
          <p>
      We may ask whether the length <m>|\vu\times\vv|</m> has any relationship to
      the lengths of <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>. To investigate, we will compute the
      square of the length <m>|\vu\times\vv|^2</m> and denote by <m>\theta</m> the
      angle between <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, as in <xref ref="S-9-3-Dot-Product">Section</xref>.
      Doing so, we find through some significant algebra that

      Therefore, we have found <m>|\vu\times\vv|^2 = |\vu|^2|\vv|^2\sin^2(\theta)</m>,
      which means that
      <men xml:id="E_9_4_cross_length">
        |\vu\times\vv| = |\vu||\vv|\sin(\theta).
      </men>
    </p>
          <p>
      Note that the third property stated above says that <m>\vu\times\vv = \vzero</m> if
      <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are parallel. This is reflected in
      Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_9_4_cross_length"/> since <m>\sin(\theta)=0</m> if <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are
      parallel, which implies that <m>\vu\times\vv = \vzero</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Equation <xref ref="E_9_4_cross_length"/> also has a geometric implication.
      Consider the parallelogram formed by two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, as
      shown in <xref ref="F_9_4_area">Figure</xref>.

          </figure>
          <p>
      Remember that the area of a parallelogram is the product of its
      base and height. As shown in the figure, we may consider the base of
      the parallelogram to be <m>|\vu|</m> and the height to be
      <m>|\vv|\sin(\theta)</m>. This means that the area of the parallelogram
      formed by <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> is
      <me>
        |\vu||\vv|\sin(\theta) = |\vu\times\vv|.
      </me>

          <p>
      This leads to the following interesting fact.

      Now that we understand the length of <m>\vu\times\vv</m>, we will
      investigate its direction. Remember from <xref ref="PA_9_4">Preview Activity</xref> that cross products involving the vectors <m>\vi</m>, <m>\vj</m>,
      and <m>\vk</m> resulted in vectors that are orthogonal to the two terms.
      We will see that this holds more generally.

          <p>
      We begin by computing <m>\vu\cdot(\vu\times\vv)</m>, and see that

    </p>
          <p>
      To summarize, we have <m>\vu\cdot(\vu\times\vv) = 0</m>, which implies that
      <m>\vu</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vu\times\vv</m>. In the same way, we can show that
      <m>\vv</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vu\times\vv</m>. The net effect is that
      <m>\vu\times\vv</m> is a vector that is perpendicular to both <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, and
      hence <m>\vu\times\vv</m> is perpendicular to the plane determined
      by <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>. Moreover, the direction of <m>\vu\times\vv</m> is
      determined by applying the right-hand rule to <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, as we
      saw in <xref ref="PA_9_4">Preview Activity</xref>. In light of our earlier work that showed

          <title>Torque is measured by a cross product</title>
          <p>
      We have seen that the cross product enables us to produce a vector
      perpendicular to two given vectors, to measure the area of a
      parallelogram, and to measure the volume of a parallelepiped. Besides
      these geometric applications, the cross product also enables us to
      describe a physical quantity called <em>torque</em>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Suppose that we would like to turn a bolt using a wrench as shown
      in <xref ref="F_9_4_wrench">Figure</xref>. If a force <m>\vF</m> is applied to the
      wrench and <m>\vr</m> is the vector from the position on the wrench at which the force is applied to center of the bolt, we define the
      torque, <m>\tau</m>, to be
      <me>
        \tau=\vF\times\vr.
      </me>
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_9_4_wrench">
            <caption>A force applied to a wrench</caption>
            <image width="50%" source="images/fig_9_4_wrench"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      When a force is applied to an object, Newton's Second Law tells us
      that the force is equal to the rate of change of the object's linear
      momentum. Similarly, the torque applied to an object is equal to the
      rate of change of the object's angular momentum. In other words,
      torque will cause the bolt to rotate.
    </p>
          <p>
      In many industrial applications, bolts are required to be tightened
      using a specified torque. Of course, the magnitude of the torque is
      <m>|\tau| =|\vF\times\vr|=|\vF||\vr||\sin(\theta)</m>. Thus, to produce a
      larger torque, we can increase either <m>|\vF|</m> or <m>|\vr|</m>, which you
      may know if you have ever removed lug nuts when changing a flat tire.
      The ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes said: <q>Give me a lever
      long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the
      world.</q> A modern spin on this statement is: <q>Allow me to make
      <m>|\vr|</m> large enough, and I shall produce a torque large enough to
      move the world.</q>

          The cross product is defined <em>only</em> for vectors in
            <m>\R^3</m>. The cross product of vectors <m>\vu = u_1 \vi + u_2 \vj + u_3 \vk</m> and <m>\vv = v_1 \vi + v_2 \vj + v_3 \vk</m> in <m>\R^3</m> is
            the vector
          <me>
            \vu \times \vv =
            (u_2v_3-u_3v_2) \vi - (u_1v_3 - u_3v_1) \vj + (u_1v_2 - u_2v_1) \vk.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          Geometrically, the cross product is
          <me>
            \vu \times \vv = |\vu| \ |\vv| \ \sin(\theta) \ \vn,
          </me>
          where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> and <m>\vn</m> is a
          unit vector perpendicular to both <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> as determined by the
          right-hand rule.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          The cross product of vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> is a vector
            perpendicular to both <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          The magnitude <m>|\vu \times \vv|</m> of the cross product of the
            vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> gives the area of the parallelogram
            determined by <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>. Also, 
            the scalar triple product <m>|(\vu \times
            \vv) \cdot \vw|</m> gives the volume of the parallelepiped determined by
            <m>\vu</m>, <m>\vv</m>, and <m>\vw</m>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
      In single variable calculus, we learn that a differentiable function is <em>locally linear</em>. <idx><h>locally linear</h></idx> In other words, if we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function at a point, the graph looks like the tangent line to the function at that point. Linear functions played important roles in single variable calculus, useful in approximating differentiable functions, in approximating roots of functions (see Newton's Method), and approximating solutions to first order differential equations (see Euler's Method). In multivariable calculus, we will soon study curves in space; differentiable curves turn out to be locally linear as well. In addition, as we study functions of two variables, we will see that such a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by the function looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on the graph.
    </p>
          <p>
      Consequently, it is important for us to understand both lines and planes in space, as these define the linear functions in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>. (Recall that a function is linear if it is a polynomial function whose terms all have degree less than or equal to 1. For example, <m>x</m> defines a single variable linear function and <m>x+y</m> a two variable linear function, but <m>xy</m> is not linear since it has degree two, the sum of the degress of its factors.) We begin our work by considering some familiar ideas in <m>\R^2</m> but from a new perspective.

        We are familiar with equations of lines in the plane in the form <m>y = mx+b</m>, where <m>m</m> is the slope of the line and <m>(0,b)</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept. In this activity, we explore a more flexible way of representing lines that we can use not only in the plane, but in higher dimensions as well.
      </p>
            <p>
        To begin, consider the line through the point <m>(2,-1)</m> with slope <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> as shown in <xref ref="F_9_5_PA_1">Figure</xref>.

              <li>
          <p>
            Suppose we increase <m>x</m> by 1 from the point <m>(2,-1)</m>. How does the <m>y</m>-value change? What is the point on the line with <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>3</m>?

            Suppose we decrease <m>x</m> by 3.25 from the point <m>(2,-1)</m>. How does the <m>y</m>-value change? What is the point on the line with <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>-1.25</m>?

            Observe that the slope of the line is related to any vector whose <m>y</m>-component divided by the <m>x</m>-component is the slope of the line. For the line in this exercise, we might use the vector <m>\langle 3,2 \rangle</m>, which describes the direction of the line. Explain why the terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>, where
            <me>
              \vr(t) = \langle 2,-1 \rangle + \langle 3,2 \rangle t,
            </me>
            trace out the graph of the line through the point <m>(2,-1)</m> with slope <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>.

            Now we extend this vector approach to <m>\R^3</m> and consider a second example. Let <m>\mathcal{L}</m> be the line in <m>\R^3</m> through the point <m>(1,0,2)</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\langle 2, -1, 4 \rangle</m>.

              Find the coordinates of three distinct points on line <m>\mathcal{L}</m>. Explain your thinking.

          <title>Lines in Space</title>
          <p>
      In two-dimensional space, a non-vertical line is defined to be the set
      of points satisfying the equation
      <me>
        y = mx + b,
      </me>
      for some constants <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>. The value of <m>m</m> (the slope) tells us how the dependent variable changes for every one unit increase in the independent variable, while the point <m>(0,b)</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept and anchors the line to a location on the <m>y</m>-axis. Alternatively, we can think of the slope as being related to the vector <m>\langle 1, m \rangle</m>, which tells us the direction of the line, as shown on the left in <xref ref="F_9_5_line">Figure</xref>. Thus, we can identify a line in space by fixing a point <m>P</m> and a direction <m>\vv</m>, as shown on the right. Since we also have vectors in space to provide direction, this same idea of a point and a direction determining a line works in <m>\R^n</m> for any <m>n</m>.

      The fixed vector <m>\vv</m> in the definition is called a

      we saw in <xref ref="PA_9_5">Preview Activity</xref>, to find an equation for a
      line through point <m>P</m> in the direction of vector <m>\vv</m>, observe that
      any vector parallel to <m>\vv</m> will have the form <m>t \vv</m> for some
      scalar <m>t</m>. So, any vector emanating from the point <m>P</m> in a direction
      parallel to the vector <m>\vv</m> will be of the form

Here, <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> is the fixed vector shown in blue, while the direction vector <m>\vv</m> is the vector parallel to the vector shown in green (that is, the green vector represents <m>t\vv</m>, and the line is traced out by the terminal points of the magenta vector). In other words, the tips (terminal points) of the magenta vectors (the vectors of the form <m>\overrightarrow{OP} + t\vv</m>) trace out the line as <m>t</m> changes.

          <p>
      In particular, the terminal points of the vectors of the form in

      following form, which is valid in any dimension.

      Of course, it is common to
      represent lines in the plane using the slope-intercept equation <m>y=mx
      + b</m>. The vector form of the line, described above, is an
      alternative way to represent lines that has the following two
      advantages. First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent
      vertical lines, whose slope <m>m</m> is not defined, using a vertical
      direction vector, such as <m>\vv=\langle 0, 1\rangle</m>. Second, this
      description of lines works in any dimension even though
      there is no concept of the slope of a line in more than two dimensions.

      The vector form of a line, <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv</m> in
      Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_9_5_line_vect"/>, describes a line as the set of
      terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>. If we write this in terms of
      components letting
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle, \ \ \ \vr_0 = \langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle, \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \vv = \langle a, b, c \rangle,
      </me>
      then we can equate the components on both sides of <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 +
      t\vv</m> to obtain the equations
      <me>
        x(t) = x_0 + at, \ \ \ \ \ y(t) = y_0 + bt, \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ z(t) = z_0 +
        ct,
      </me>
      which describe the coordinates of the points on the line. The
      variable <m>t</m> represents an arbitrary scalar and is called a
      <em>parameter</em>. In particular, we use the following language.

      Notice that there are many different parametric equations for the same

      another direction vector <m>\vv</m> produces another set of parametric
      equations. It is sometimes useful to think of <m>t</m> as a time parameter
      and the parametric equations as telling us where we are on the line at
      each time. In this way, the parametric equations describe a
      particular walk taken along the line; there are, of course,
      many possible ways to walk along a line.

          <p>
      Now that we have a way of describing lines, we would like to develop a means of describing planes in three dimensions. We studied the coordinate planes and planes parallel to them in <xref ref="S-9-1-Functions">Section</xref>. Each of those planes had one of the variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m> equal to a constant. We can note that any vector in a plane with <m>x</m> constant is orthogonal to the vector <m>\langle 1,0,0 \rangle</m>, any vector in a plane with <m>y</m> constant is orthogonal to the vector <m>\langle 0,1,0 \rangle</m>, and any vector in a plane with <m>z</m> constant is orthogonal to the vector <m>\langle 0,0,1 \rangle</m>. This idea works in general to define a plane.
    </p>
          <definition>
            <statement>
              <p>
          A
          <term>plane</term><idx><h>plane</h><h>definition</h></idx> <m>p</m> in space is the set of
          all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point
          <m>P_0</m> perpendicular to a fixed vector <m>\vn</m>, as shown in <xref ref="F_9_5_plane_normal">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <figure xml:id="F_9_5_plane_normal">
            <caption>A point <m>P_0</m> on a plane <m>p</m> with a normal vector <m>\vn</m></caption>
            <image width="73%" source="images/fig_9_5_plane_normal"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      The definition allows us to find the equation of a plane. Assume that <m>\vn=\langle a,b,c\rangle</m>, <m>P_0 =
      (x_0, y_0, z_0)</m>, and that <m>P=(x,y,z)</m> is an arbitrary point on the plane.
      Since the vector <m>\overrightarrow{PP_0}</m> lies in
      the plane, it must be perpendicular to <m>\vn</m>. This means that
      <md><mrow>0 =\mathstrut \amp  \vn\cdot\overrightarrow{PP_0}</mrow><mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \vn\cdot \big(\langle x,y,z \rangle - \langle x_0, y_0,
            z_0\rangle\big)</mrow><mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \vn \cdot \langle x-x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0 \rangle</mrow><mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0).</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      The fixed vector <m>\vn</m> perpendicular to the plane is frequently called
      a <em>normal vector</em> to the plane. We may now summarize as follows.

        </li></ul>
    </p>
          </assemblage>
          <p>
      We may take the scalar equation of a plane a little further and note that since
      <me>
        a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0,
      </me>
      it equivalently follows that
      <me>
        ax + by + cz = ax_0+by_0+cz_0.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      That is, we may write an equation of a plane as <m>ax+by+cz = d</m> where
      <m>d = \vn\cdot\langle x_0,y_0,z_0\rangle</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      For instance, if we would like to describe the plane passing through
      the point <m>P_0=(4, -2,1)</m> and perpendicular to the vector <m>\vn =
      \langle 1, 2, 1 \rangle</m>, we have
      <me>
        \langle 1,2,1 \rangle\cdot \langle x,y,z\rangle =
          \langle 1,2,1 \rangle\cdot \langle 4,-2,1\rangle
      </me>
      or
      <me>
        x + 2y + z = 1.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Notice that the coefficients of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> in this description
      give a vector perpendicular to the plane. For instance, if we are
      presented with the plane
      <me>
        -2x + y - 3z = 4,
      </me>
      we know that <m>\vn = \langle -2, 1, -3\rangle</m> is a vector
      perpendicular to the plane.

      Just as two distinct points in space determine a line, three
      non-collinear points in space determine a plane.
      Consider three points <m>P_0</m>, <m>P_1</m>, and <m>P_2</m> in space, not all lying
      on the same line as shown in <xref ref="F_9_5_Plane">Figure</xref>.

      Observe that the vectors <m>\overrightarrow{P_0P_1}</m> and

        <p>
          While lines in <m>\R^3</m> do not have a slope, like lines in <m>\R^2</m> they can be characterized by a point and a direction vector.  Indeed, we define a line in space to be the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          Vectors play a critical role in representing the equation of a line.  In particular, the terminal points of the vector <m>\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv</m> define a linear function <m>\vr</m> in space through the terminal point of the vector <m>\vr_0</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\vv</m>, tracing out a line in space.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          A plane in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          If <m>P_1</m>, <m>P_2</m>, and <m>P_3</m> are non-collinear points in space, the vectors <m>\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}</m> and and <m>\overrightarrow{P_1P_3}</m>  are vectors in the plane and the vector <m>\vn = \overrightarrow{P_1P_2} \times \overrightarrow{P_1P_3}</m> is a normal vector to the plane. So any point <m>P</m> in the plane satisfies the equation <m>\overrightarrow{PP_1} \cdot \vn = 0</m>.  If we let <m>P = (x,y,z)</m>, <m>\vn = \langle a,b,c \rangle</m> be the normal vector, and <m>P_1 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>, we can also represent the plane with the equation
          <me>
            a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      The figure below shows the two lines the plane must contain.




      <sidebyside widths="33.3333333333333%"><image source="images/webwork-55-image-1.png"/></sidebyside>




      Both lines are parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis; thus our plane must have
      <m>x</m>-slope zero. On the other hand, the line in the <m>xy</m>-plane is
      2 units down and  unit in front of of the line in the
      <m>y z</m>-plane; hence the <m>y</m>-slope of our plane must be <m>-2</m>.
      Thus the equation is
      <me>z = 0 x - 2 y + c,</me>
      for some constant <m>c</m>. Since the plane contains the point
      <m>(0,0,2)</m>, the value of <m>c</m> must be 2.
      So the equation is
      <me>z = -2 y + 2.</me>
      This is shown in the graph below.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 




      The revenue
      function, <m>R</m>, is linear and so we may write it as:
      <me>R = (p_1)c + (p_2)d</me>
      where <m>p_1</m> is the price of CDs and <m>p_2</m> is the price of DVDs, in
      dollars.
      From the diagram, we can pick two points, such as <m>c = 150</m>, <m>d=250</m>
      on the contour <m>R=5000</m>, and <m>c = 250</m>, <m>d = 250</m> on the contour
      <m>R = 6000</m>.  These
      points give the following system of linear equations:
      <me>5000 = 150 p_1 + 250 p_2, \mbox{ and }
      6000 = 250 p_1 + 250 p_2.</me>
      Solving gives <m>p_1 = 10</m> dollars and <m>p_2 = 14</m> dollars.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      The time in minutes to go 8 miles at a speed of <m>s</m> mph is
      <m>(8/s)(60)= 480/s</m>.  Thus  the 180 lb person going
      9 mph uses <m>(8.6)(600/9) = 458.667</m> calories,
      and the 200 lb person going 8 mph uses
      <m>(7.9)(600/8) = 474</m> calories.



      <alert>(b)</alert>
      The 180 lb person burns <m>458.667/180 = 2.54815</m>
      calories per pound for the trip, while the 200 lb person
      burns <m>474/200 = 2.37</m> calories per pound for the trip.

        <introduction>
          <p>
      So far, we have seen several different examples of curves in space,
      including traces and contours of functions of two variables, as well
      as lines in 3-space. Recall that for a line through a fixed point
      <m>\vr_0</m> in the direction of vector <m>\vv</m>, we may express the line
      parametrically through the single vector equation
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      From this perspective, the vector <m>\vr(t)</m> is a function that depends
      on the parameter <m>t</m>, and the terminal points of this vector trace out
      the line in space.
    </p>
          <p>
      Like lines, other curves in space are one-dimensional objects, and
      thus we aspire to similarly express the coordinates of points on a
      given curve in terms of a single variable. Vectors are a perfect
      vehicle for doing so <mdash/> we can use vectors based at the origin to
      identify points in space, and connect the terminal points of these
      vectors to draw a curve in space. This approach will allow us to draw
      an incredible variety of graphs in 2- and 3-space, as well as to
      identify and describe curves in <m>n</m>-space for any <m>n</m>. It will also allow us to represent traces and cross sections of surfaces in space.

        <subsection>
          <title>Vector-Valued Functions</title>
          <p>
      Consider the curve shown in <xref ref="F_9_6_VVF_graph">Figure</xref>. As in
      <xref ref="PA_9_6">Preview Activity</xref>, we can think of a point on this curve
      as resulting from a vector from the origin to the point. As the point
      travels along the curve, the vector changes in order to terminate at
      the desired point.
      A few still pictures of this motion are shown in <xref ref="F_9_6_VVF_graph">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_9_6_VVF_graph">
            <caption>The graph of a curve in space.</caption>
            <sidebyside widths="33% 33% 33%" margins="0%">
              <image source="images/fig_9_6_curve_animate_01"/>
              <image source="images/fig_9_6_curve_animate_25"/>
              <image source="images/fig_9_6_curve_animate_40"/>
            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      Thus, we can think of the curve as a collection of terminal points of
      vectors emanating from the origin. We therefore view a point traveling
      along this curve as a function of time <m>t</m>, and define a function
      <m>\vr</m> whose input is the variable <m>t</m> and whose output is the vector
      from the origin to the point on the curve at time <m>t</m>. In so doing,
      we have introduced a new type of function, one whose input is a scalar
      and whose output is a vector.
    </p>
          <p>
      The terminal points of the vector outputs of <m>\vr</m> then trace out the
      curve in space. From this perspective, the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>
      coordinates of the point are functions of time, <m>t</m>, say
      <me>
        x = x(t), \ \ \ y = y(t), \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ z = z(t),
      </me>
      and thus we have three coordinate functions that enable us to
      represent the curve. The variable <m>t</m> is called a <em>parameter</em> and
      the equations <m>x = x(t)</m>, <m>y = y(t)</m>, and <m>z = z(t)</m> are called
      <em>parametric equations</em> (or a <em>parameterization of the
      curve</em>). The function <m>\vr</m> whose output is the vector from the
      origin to a point on the curve is defined by
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Note that the input of <m>\vr</m> is the real-valued parameter <m>t</m> and the
      corresponding output is vector <m>\langle x(t), y(t), z(t)
      \rangle</m>. Such a function is called a <em>vector-valued function</em>
      because each real number input generates a vector output. More
      formally, we state the following definition.

          <term>Parametric equations</term><idx><h>parametric equations for a
          curve</h></idx><idx><h>parameterization</h><h>curve</h></idx> for a curve are equations of the form
          <me>
            x = x(t), \ \ \ y = y(t), \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ z = z(t)
          </me>
          that describe the <m>(x,y,z)</m> coordinates of a point on a curve in <m>\R^3</m>.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
      Note particularly that every set of parametric equations determines a
      vector-valued function of the form
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle,
      </me>
      and every vector-valued function defines a set of parametric equations
      for a curve. Moreover, we can consider vector-valued functions and
      parameterizations in <m>\R^2</m>, <m>\R^4</m>, or indeed a real space of any
      dimension. As a reminder, in <xref ref="S-9-5-Lines-Planes">Section</xref>, we
      determined the parametric equations of a line in space using a point
      and a direction vector. For a nonlinear example, the curve in <xref ref="F_9_6_VVF_graph">Figure</xref> has the parametric equations
      <me>
        x(t) = \cos(t), \ \ \ y(t) = \sin(t), \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ z(t)
        = \cos(t) \sin(t).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Represented as a vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>,
      the curve in <xref ref="F_9_6_VVF_graph">Figure</xref> is the graph of
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), \cos(t) \sin(t) \rangle.

      The examples in <xref ref="A_9_6_1">Activity</xref> illustrate that a
      parameterization allows us to look not only at the graph, but at the
      direction and speed at which the graph is traversed as <m>t</m> changes. In
      the different parameterizations of the circle, we see that we can
      start at different points and move around the circle in either
      direction. The calculus of vector-valued functions <mdash/> which we will
      begin to investigate in
      <xref ref="S-9-7-Vector-Valued-Functions-Derivatives">Section</xref> <mdash/> will enable
      us to precisely quantify the direction, speed, and acceleration of a
      particle moving along a curve in space. As such, describing curves
      parametrically will allow us to not only indicate the curve itself,
      but also to describe how motion occurs along the curve.

          <p>
      Using parametric equations to define vector-valued functions in two
      dimensions is much more versatile than just defining <m>y</m> as a function
      of <m>x</m>. In fact, if <m>y = f(x)</m> is a function of <m>x</m>, then we can
      parameterize the graph of <m>f</m> by
      <me>
        \vr(t) = \langle t, f(t) \rangle,
      </me>
      and thus every single-variable function may be described
      parametrically. In addition, as we saw in <xref ref="PA_9_6">Preview Activity</xref> and <xref ref="A_9_6_1">Activity</xref>, we can use vector-valued
      functions to represent curves in the plane that do not define <m>y</m> as a
      function of <m>x</m> (or <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>). (As a side note: vector-valued functions make it easy to plot the inverse of a one-to-one function in two dimensions. To see how, if <m>y = f(x)</m>defines a one-to-one function, then we can parameterize this function by <m>\vr(t) = \langle t, f(t) \rangle</m>. Since the inverse function just reverses the role of input and output, a parameterization for <m>f^{-1}</m> is <m>\langle f(t), t \rangle</m>.)

      Recall from our earlier work that the traces and level curves of a
      function are themselves curves in space. Thus, we may determine
      parameterizations for them. For example, if <m>z = f(x,y) = \cos(x^2 +
      y^2)</m>, the <m>y = 1</m> trace of the function is given by setting <m>y = 1</m>
      and letting <m>x</m> be parameterized by the variable <m>t</m>; then, the trace
      is the curve whose parameterization is <m>\langle t, 1, \cos(t^2 + 1)
      \rangle.</m>

            <li>
        <p>
          A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a real
            parameter <m>t</m> and whose output is a vector that depends on <m>t</m>. The
            graph of a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points
            of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          Every vector-valued function provides a parameterization of a
            curve. In <m>\R^2</m>, a parameterization of a curve is a pair of
            equations <m>x = x(t)</m> and <m>y = y(t)</m> that describes the coordinates
            of a point <m>(x,y)</m> on the curve in terms of a parameter <m>t</m>. In
            <m>\R^3</m>, a parameterization of a curve is a set of three equations <m>x
            = x(t)</m>, <m>y=y(t)</m>, and <m>z = z(t)</m> that describes the coordinates of
            a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> on the curve in terms of a parameter <m>t</m>.

          <p>
      A vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> determines a curve in space as the
      collection of terminal points of the vectors <m>\vr(t)</m>. If the curve is
      smooth, it is natural to ask whether <m>\vr(t)</m> has a derivative. In
      the same way, our experiences with integrals in single-variable
      calculus prompt us to wonder what the integral of a vector-valued
      function might be and what it might tell us. We
      explore both of these questions in detail in this section.
    </p>
          <p>
      For now, let's recall some important ideas from calculus I. Given a
      function <m>s</m> that measures the position of an object moving along
      an axis, its derivative, <m>s'</m>, is defined by
      <me>
        s'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{s(t+h) - s(t)}{h},
      </me>
      and measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>s</m> with respect to
      time. In particular, for a fixed value <m>t = a</m>, <m>s'(a)</m> measures the
      velocity of the moving object, as well as the slope of the tangent
      line to the curve <m>y = s(t)</m> at the point <m>(a,s(a))</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      As we work with vector-valued functions, we will strive to update
      these ideas and perspectives into the context of curves in space and
      outputs that are vectors.

          <title>The Derivative</title>
          <p>
      In single variable calculus, we define the derivative, <m>f'</m>, of a
      given function <m>f</m> by
      <me>
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h},
      </me>
      provided the limit exists. At a given value of <m>a</m>, <m>f'(a)</m> measures
      the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m>, and also tells us the slope
      of the tangent line to the curve <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a, f(a))</m>.
      The definition of the derivative extends naturally to vector-valued
      functions and curves in space.

      As <xref ref="A_9_7_1">Activity</xref> indicates, if <m>\vr(t)</m> determines the
      position of an object at time <m>t</m>, then <m>\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}</m>
      represents the average rate of change in the position of the object over the
      interval <m>[t,t+h]</m>, which is also the average velocity of the object
      on this interval. Thus, the derivative
      <me>
        \vr'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}
      </me>
      is the
      instantaneous rate of change of <m>\vr(t)</m> at time <m>t</m> (for those values
      of <m>t</m> for which the limit exists), so <m>\vr'(t) = \vv(t)</m> is the
      instantaneous velocity of the object at time <m>t</m>. Furthermore, we can
      interpret the derivative <m>\vr'(t)</m> as the direction vector of the line
      tangent to the graph of <m>\vr</m> at the value <m>t</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Similarly,
      <me>
        \vv'(t) = \vr''(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vv(t+h)-\vv(t)}{h}
      </me>
      is
      the instantaneous rate of change of the velocity of the object at time
      <m>t</m>, for those values of <m>t</m> for which the limits exists, and thus
      <m>\vv'(t) = \va(t)</m> is the acceleration of the moving object.
    </p>
          <p>
      <em>Note well:</em> Both the velocity and acceleration are <em>vector
      quantities</em>: they have magnitude and direction. By contrast, the
      magnitude of the velocity vector, <m>| \vv(t) |</m>, which is the <em>speed</em> of
      the object at time <m>t</m>, is a scalar quantity.

        <subsection>
          <title>Computing Derivatives</title>
          <p>
      As we learned in single variable calculus, computing derivatives from
      the definition is often difficult. Fortunately, properties of the
      limit make it straightforward to calculate the derivative of a
      vector-valued function similar to how we developed
      shortcut differentiation rules in calculus I. To see why, recall that
      the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, and that we can remove
      constant factors from limits. Thus, as we observed in a particular
      example in <xref ref="PA_9_7">Preview Activity</xref>, if <m>\vr(t) = x(t) \vi + y(t)
      \vj + z(t) \vk</m>, it follows that
      <md><mrow>\vr'(t) = \mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}</mrow><mrow> = \mathstrut \amp \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[x(t+h)-x(t)] \vi + [y(t+h)-y(t)] \vj +
        [z(t+h)-z(t)] \vk}{h}</mrow><mrow> = \mathstrut \amp \left(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x(t+h)-x(t)}{h}
        \right) \vi + \left( \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{y(t+h)-y(t)}{h} \right) \vj</mrow><mrow> \mathstrut \amp  + \left( \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{z(t+h)-z(t)}{h} \right)\vk</mrow><mrow>\mathstrut \amp = x'(t)\vi + y'(t) \vj + z'(t) \vk.</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      Thus, we can calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function by
      simply differentiating its components.

      In first-semester calculus, we developed several important
      differentiation rules, including the constant multiple, product,
      quotient, and chain rules. For instance, recall that we formally
      state the product rule as
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f(x)\cdot g'(x) + g(x)\cdot f'(x).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      There are several analogous rules for vector-valued functions,
      including a product rule for scalar functions and vector-valued
      functions. These rules, which are easily verified, are summarized as
      follows.

          <title>Tangent Lines</title>
          <p>
      One of the most important ideas in first-semester calculus is that a
      differentiable function is <em>locally linear</em>: that is, when viewed
      up close, the curve generated by a differentiable function looks very
      much like a line. Indeed, when we zoom in sufficiently far on a
      particular point, the curve looks indistinguishable from its tangent
      line.
    </p>
          <p>
      In the same way, we expect that a smooth curve in 3-space will be
      locally linear. In the following activity, we investigate how to find
      the tangent line to such a curve. Recall from our work in
      <xref ref="S-9-5-Lines-Planes">Section</xref> that the vector equation of a line that
      passes through the point at the tip of the vector <m>\vL_0 = \langle
      x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\vu = \langle
      a, b, c \rangle</m> can be written as
      <me>
        \vL(t) = \vL_0 + t \vu.

    </p>
          <p>
      In parametric form, the line <m>\vL</m> is given by
      <me>
        x(t) = x_0 + at, \ \ y(t) = y_0 + bt, \ \ z(t) = z_0 + ct.

          <p>
      We see that our work in <xref ref="A_9_7_4">Activity</xref> can be generalized.
      Given a differentiable vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>, the tangent
      line to the curve at the input value <m>a</m> is given by
      <men xml:id="E_TanLineVecFxn">
        \vL(t) = \vr(a) + t \vr'(a).
      </men>
    </p>
          <p>
      Here we see that because the tangent line is determined
      entirely by a given point and direction, the point is provided by the
      function <m>\vr</m>, evaluated at <m>t = a</m>, while the direction is
      provided by the derivative, <m>\vr'</m>, again evaluated at <m>t = a</m>.
      Note how analogous the formula for <m>\vL(t)</m> is to the tangent line
      approximation from single-variable calculus: in that context, for a
      given function <m>y = f(x)</m> at a value <m>x = a</m>, we found that the
      tangent line can be expressed by the linear function <m>y = L(x)</m> whose
      formula is
      <me>
        L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_TanLineVecFxn"/> for the tangent line <m>\vL(t)</m> to the vector-valued function <m>\vr(t)</m> is nearly identical. Indeed, because there are multiple parameterizations for a single line, it is even possible to write the parameterization
      as
      <men xml:id="E_TanLineVecFxn2">
        \vL(t) = \vr(a) + (t-a)
        \vr'(a).
      </men>
      (For example, in Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_TanLineVecFxn"/>, <m>\vL(0) = \vr(a)</m>, so the line's parameterization <q>starts</q> at <m>t = 0</m>.  When we write the parameterization in the form of
      Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_TanLineVecFxn2"/>, <m>\vL(a) = \vr(a)</m>, so the line's parameterization <q>starts</q> at <m>t = a</m>.)
    </p>
          <p>
      As we will learn more in Chapter 10, a smooth surface in 3-space is
      also locally linear. That means that the surface will look like a
      plane, which we call its <em>tangent plane</em>, as we zoom in on the
      graph. It is possible to use tangent lines to traces of the surface
      to generate a formula for the tangent plane; see
      <xref ref="Ez_9_7_3">Exercise</xref> at the end of this section for more details.

      satisfies <m>F'(x) = f(x)</m>. We then defined the indefinite integral
      <m>\int f(x) \ dx</m> to be the general antiderivative of <m>f</m>. Recall that
      the general antiderivative includes an added constant <m>C</m> in order to
      indicate that the general antiderivative is in fact an entire family
      of functions. We can do the similar work with vector-valued functions.

      The same reasoning that allows us to differentiate a vector-valued
      function componentwise applies to integrating as well. Recall that the
      integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals and also that we can
      remove constant factors from integrals. So, given <m>{\vr(t) = x(t) \vi
      + y(t) \vj + z(t) \vk}</m>, it follows that we can integrate
      componentwise. Expressed more formally,

      In light of being able to integrate and differentiate componentwise
      with vector-valued functions, we can solve many problems that are
      analogous to those we encountered in single-variable calculus. For
      instance, recall problems where we were given an object moving along
      an axis with velocity function <m>v</m> and an initial position <m>s(0)</m>.
      In that context, we were able to differentiate <m>v</m> in order to find

          <title>Projectile Motion</title>
          <p>
      Any time that an object is launched into the air with a given velocity
      and launch angle, the path the object travels is determined almost
      exclusively by the force of gravity. Whether in sports such as
      archery or shotput, in military applications with artillery, or in
      important fields like firefighting, it is important to be able to know
      when and where a launched projectile will land. We can use our
      knowledge of vector-valued functions in order to completely determine
      the path traveled by an object that is launched from a given position
      at a given angle from the horizontal with a given initial velocity.

          <p>
      Assume we fire a projectile from a launcher and the only force acting
      on the fired object is the force of gravity pulling down on the
      object. That is, we assume no effect due to spin, wind, or air
      resistance. With these assumptions, the motion of the object will be
      planar, so we can also assume that the motion occurs in
      two-dimensional space. Suppose we launch the object from an initial
      position <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> at an angle <m>\theta</m> with the positive <m>x</m>-axis
      as illustrated in <xref ref="F_9_7_Motion">Figure</xref>, and that we fire the
      object with an initial speed of <m>v_0 = |\vv(0)|</m>, where <m>\vv(t)</m> is
      the velocity vector of the object at time <m>t</m>. Assume <m>g</m> is the
      positive constant acceleration force due to gravity, which acts to
      pull the fired object toward the ground (in the negative <m>y</m>
      direction). Note particularly that there is no external force acting
      on the object to move it in the <m>x</m> direction.
    </p>
          <p>
      We first observe that since gravity only acts in the downward
      direction and that the acceleration due to gravity is constant,
      the acceleration vector is <m>\langle 0, -g
      \rangle</m>. That is, <m>\va(t) = \langle 0, -g \rangle</m>. We may use this
      fact about acceleration, together with the initial position and
      initial velocity in order to fully determine the position <m>\vr(t)</m> of the object at time <m>t</m>. In <xref ref="Ez_9_7_5">Exercise</xref>, you

          The derivative <m>\vr'(t)</m> of the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>
          tells us the instantaneous rate of change of <m>\vr</m> with respect to

          tangent to the graph of <m>\vr</m> at the point <m>\vr(t)</m>, or also as the

          An antiderivative of <m>\vr</m> is a vector-valued function <m>\vR</m>

          dt</m> of a vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> is the general antiderivative of
          <m>\vr</m> (which is a collection of all of the antiderivatives of <m>\vr</m>,
          with any two antiderivatives differing by at most a constant vector).
          Moreover, if <m>\vr(t) = x(t) \vi + y(t) \vj + z(t) \vk</m>, then

        The WeBWorK problems are written by many different authors. Some authors use parentheses when writing vectors, e.g., <m>(x(t),y(t),z(t))</m> instead of angle brackets <m>\langle x(t),y(t),z(t) \rangle</m>. Please keep this in mind when working WeBWorK exercises.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      Since <m>z=80</m> feet when <m>t=0</m>, the tower is 80 feet high.




      <alert>(b)</alert>
      The child reaches the bottom when <m>z=0</m>, so <m>t=80/5=16</m> minutes.




      <alert>(c)</alert>
      Her velocity is given by
      <me>\vec v =\frac{d\vec r}{dt} = -(30\sin t)\vec i +(30\cos t)\vec j - 5\vec k,</me>
      so
      <me>\hbox{Speed} = ||\vec v|| = \sqrt{(-30\sin t)^2+(30\cos t)^2 + (-5)^2}
      = \sqrt{30^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{925} \mbox{ ft/min}.</me><alert>(c)</alert>
      Her acceleration is given by
      <me>\vec a = \frac{d\vec v}{dt} = -(30 \cos t)\vec i -(30 \sin t)\vec j
      \mbox{ ft/min}^2.</me></solution>

            A <em>central force</em> is one that

      Given a space curve, there are two natural
      geometric questions one might ask: how long is the curve and how much
      does it bend? In this section, we answer both questions by
      developing techniques for measuring the length of a space
      curve as well as its curvature.

        In earlier investigations, we have used
        integration to calculate quantities such as area, volume, mass, and
        work. We are now interested in determining the
        length of a space curve.
      </p>
            <p>
        Consider the smooth curve in 3-space defined by the vector-valued
        function <m>\vr</m>, where
        <me>
          \vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle = \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), t \rangle
        </me>
        for <m>t</m> in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m>. Pictures of the graph of <m>\vr</m> are shown in <xref ref="F-9-8-Arclength">Figure</xref>.
        We will use the integration process to calculate the length of this curve. In this situation we partition the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> into <m>n</m> subintervals of equal length and let <m>0 = t_0 \lt  t_1 \lt  t_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  t_n = b</m> be the endpoints of the subintervals. We then approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with some related quantity that we can compute. In this case, we approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with the length of the segment connecting the endpoints. <xref ref="F-9-8-Arclength">Figure</xref> illustrates the process in three different instances using increasing values of <m>n</m>.

          <p>
      Consider a smooth curve in 3-space that is parametrically described by
      the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> defined by <m>\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t)
      \rangle.</m>
      <xref ref="PA_9_8">Preview Activity</xref> shows that to approximate the
      length of the curve defined by <m>\vr(t)</m> as the values of <m>t</m> run over
      an interval <m>[a,b]</m>, we partition the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m>
      subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta t</m>, with <m>a = t_0 \lt  t_1 \lt  \cdots
      \lt  t_n = b</m> as the endpoints of the subintervals. On each subinterval,
      we approximate the length of the curve by the length of the line
      segment connecting the endpoints. The points on the curve
      corresponding to <m>t = t_{i-1}</m> and <m>t = t_i</m> are <m>(x(t_{i-1}),
      y(t_{i-1}), z(t_{i-1}))</m> and <m>(x(t_i), y(t_i), z(t_i))</m>, respectively,
      so the length of the line segment connecting these points is
      <me>
        \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) -
          z(t_{i-1}))^2}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Now we add all of these approximations together to obtain an
      approximation to the length <m>L</m> of the curve:
      <me>
        L \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) -
          y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      We now want to take the limit of this sum as <m>n</m> goes to infinity, but in its present form it
      might be difficult to see how. We first introduce <m>\Delta t</m> by multiplying by <m>\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t}</m>, and see that
      <md><mrow>L \amp \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2}</mrow><mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2} \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t}</mrow><mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2} \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{(\Delta t)^2}}</mrow></md>
    </p>

          <title>Parameterizing With Respect To Arc Length</title>
          <p>
      In addition to helping us to find the length of space curves, the
      expression for the length of a curve enables us to find a natural
      parametrization of space curves in terms of arc length, as we now
      explain.
    </p>
          <p>
      Shown below in <xref ref="F_9_8_parametrization">Figure</xref> is a portion of the
      parabola <m>y = x^2/2</m>. Of course, this space curve may be parametrized by
      the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m> defined by <m>\vr(t) = \langle t, t^2/2\rangle</m> as shown
      on the left, where we see the location at a few different times <m>t</m>.
      Notice that the points are not equally spaced on the curve.
    </p>
          <p>
      A more natural parameter describing the points along the space curve
      is the distance traveled <m>s</m> as we move along the parabola starting at
      the origin. For instance, the right side of <xref ref="F_9_8_parametrization">Figure</xref> shows the points corresponding to various
      values of <m>s</m>. We call this an <em>arc length parametrization</em>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_9_8_parametrization">
            <caption>The parametrization <m>\vr(t)</m> (left) and a
            reparametrization by arc length.</caption>
            <image width="100%" source="images/fig_9_8_param"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      To see that this is a more natural parametrization, consider an
      interstate highway cutting across a state. One way
      to parametrize the curve defined by the highway is to drive along the
      highway and record our position at every time, thus creating a
      function <m>\vr</m>. If we encounter an accident or road construction,
      however,
      this parametrization might not be at all relevant to another person
      driving the same highway. An arc length parametrization, however, is
      like using the mile markers on the side of road to specify our
      position on the highway. If we know how far we've traveled along the
      highway, we know exactly where we are.
    </p>
          <p>
      If we begin with a parametrization of a space curve, we can
      modify it to find an arc length parametrization, as we now describe.
      Suppose that the curve is parametrized by the vector-valued function
      <m>\vr = \vr(t)</m> where <m>t</m> is in the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. We define the
      parameter <m>s</m> through the function
      <me>
        s=L(t) = \int_a^t \sqrt{(x'(w))^2 + (y'(w))^2 + (z'(w))^2} \,dw,
      </me>
      which measures the length along the curve from <m>\vr(a)</m> to
      <m>\vr(t)</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows us that
      <men xml:id="eq_9_8_arc_length_prime">
        \frac{ds}{dt} =
          L'(t)=
          \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2} = \lvert \vr'(t) \rvert
      </men>
      and so
      <me>
        L(t) = \int_a^t \left| \frac{d}{dw}\vr(w)\right| \,dw.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      If we assume that <m>\vr'(t)</m> is never 0, then <m>L'(t) &gt; 0</m> for all <m>t</m>
      and <m>s=L(t)</m> is always increasing. This should seem reasonable: unless we
      stop, the distance traveled along the curve increases as we move along
      the curve.
    </p>
          <p>
      Since <m>s=L(t)</m> is an increasing function, it is invertible, which means
      we may view the time <m>t</m> as a function of the distance traveled; that
      is, we have the relationship <m>t=L^{-1}(s)</m>. We then obtain the arc length
      parametrization by composing <m>\vr(t)</m> with <m>t=L^{-1}(s)</m> to obtain
      <m>\vr(s)</m>. Let's illustrate this with an example.
    </p>
          <example xml:id="ex_9_8_circle_arc_length">
            <p>
          Consider a circle of
          radius <m>5</m> in 2-space centered at the origin. We know that we can
          parameterize this circle as
          <me>
            \vr(t) = \langle 5\cos(t), 5\sin(t) \rangle,

          We see that <m>\vr'(t) = \langle -5\sin(t), 5\cos(t) \rangle</m>, and hence
          <m>|\vr'(t)| = 5</m>. It then follows that
          <me>
            s=L(t) = \int_0^t |\vr'(w)|~dw = \int_0^t 5~dw = 5t.
          </me>
        </p>
            <p>
          Since <m>s=L(t) = 5t</m>, we may solve for <m>t</m> in terms of <m>s</m> to obtain
          <m>t(s)=L^{-1}(s) 
            = s/5</m>. We then find the arc length parametrization by composing
          <me>
            \vr(t(s))=\vr(L^{-1}(s)) = \left\langle 5\cos\left(\frac s5\right),
              5\sin\left(\frac s5\right)\right\rangle.

        <subsection>
          <title>Curvature</title>
          <p>
      For a smooth space curve, the <em>curvature</em> measures how fast the
      curve is bending or changing direction at a given point. For example,
      we expect that a line should have zero curvature everywhere, while a
      circle (which is bending the same at every point) should have constant
      curvature. Circles with larger radii should have smaller curvatures.
    </p>
          <p>
      To measure the curvature, we first need to describe the direction of the curve at a point. We may do this using a continuously varying tangent vector to the curve, as shown at left in <xref ref="F_9_8_Curvature_1_a">Figure</xref>. The direction of the curve is then determined by the angle <m>\phi</m> each tangent vector makes with a horizontal vector, as shown at right in <xref ref="F_9_8_Curvature_1_a">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_9_8_Curvature_1_a">
            <caption>Left: Tangent vectors to an ellipse. Right: Angles of tangent vectors. </caption>

            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      Informally speaking, the curvature will be
      the rate at which the angle <m>\phi</m> is changing as we move along the
      curve. Of course, this rate of change will depend on how we move
      along the curve; if we move with a greater speed along the curve,
      then <m>\phi</m> will change more rapidly. This is why the speed limit is
      sometimes lowered when we enter a curve on a highway. In other words,
      the rate of change of <m>\phi</m> will depend on the parametrization we use
      to describe the space curve. To eliminate this dependence on the
      parametrization, we choose to work with an arc
      length parametrization <m>\vr(s)</m>, which means we move along the curve
      with unit speed.
    </p>
          <p>
      Using an arc length parametrization <m>\vr(s)</m>, we define the tangent vector
      <m>\vT(s) = \vr'(s)</m>, and note that <m>|\vT(s)| = 1</m>; that is, <m>\vT(s)</m> is
      a unit tangent vector. We then have <m>\vT(s) = \langle \cos (\phi(s)),
      \sin(\phi(s)) \rangle</m>,
      which means that
      <me>
        \frac{d\vT}{ds} = \left\langle -\sin(\phi(s)) \frac{d\phi}{ds}, ~
        \cos(\phi(s)) \frac{d\phi}{ds} \right\rangle = 
        \langle -\sin(\phi(s)),~
        \cos(\phi(s)) \rangle \frac{d\phi}{ds}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Therefore
      <me>
        \left|\frac{d\vT}{ds}\right| =  \left|\langle -\sin(\phi(s)),~
        \cos(\phi(s)) \rangle\right| ~\left|\frac{d\phi}{ds}\right| = 
        \left|\frac{d\phi}{ds}\right|

        Recall that an arc length
        parameterization of a circle in 2-space of radius <m>a</m> centered at
        the origin is, from

      </p>

      <p>
        Show that the curvature
        of this circle is the constant <m>\frac{1}{a}</m>. What can you say about the relationship between the size of the radius of a circle and the value of its curvature? Why does this make sense?

      The definition of curvature relies on our
      ability to parameterize curves in terms of arc length. Since we have
      seen that finding an arc length parametrization can be difficult, we
      would like to be able to express the curvature in terms of a more
      general parametrization <m>\vr(t)</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      To begin, we need to describe the vector <m>\vT</m>, which is
      a vector tangent to the curve having unit length. Of course, the
      velocity vector <m>\vr'(t)</m> is tangent to the curve; we simply need to
      normalize its length to be one. This means that we may take
      <men xml:id="eq_9_8_unit_tangent">
        \vT(t) = \frac{\vr'(t)}{|\vr'(t)|}.
      </men>
    </p>
          <p>
      Then the curvature of the curve defined by <m>\vr</m> is
      <md><mrow>\kappa \amp = \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{ds} \right\rvert</mrow><mrow>\amp = \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{dt} \frac{dt}{ds} \right\rvert</mrow><mrow>\amp = \frac{\left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{dt} \right\rvert}{ \left\lvert \frac{ds}{dt} \right\rvert }</mrow><mrow>\amp = \frac{\left\lvert \vT'(t) \right\rvert}{ \left\lvert \vr'(t) \right\rvert}.</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      This last formula allows us to use any parameterization of a curve to
      calculate its curvature. There is another useful formula, given
      below, whose derivation is left for the exercises.

      The curvature has another interpretation. Recall that the tangent line to a curve at a point is the line that best approximates the curve at that point. The curvature at a point on a curve describes the <em>circle</em> that best approximates the curve at that point. Remembering that a circle of radius <m>a</m> has curvature <m>1/a</m>, then the
      circle that best approximates the curve near a point on a curve whose curvature is <m>\kappa</m> has radius <m>1/\kappa</m> and will be tangent to the tangent line at that point and has its center on the concave side of the curve. This circle, called the <em>osculating circle</em> of the curve at the point, is shown in <xref ref="F_9_8_osculating">Figure</xref> for a portion of a parabola.

          Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with respect to arc length, we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of curvature and the result is a measure that depends only on the geometry of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.

       SOLUTION 



      We have
      <me>\hbox{Length} = \int_2^3
          \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2}\,dt =
        \int_{2}^{3} \sqrt{(5)^2+(4)^2+(1)^2}\,dt = \sqrt{42}.</me>
      This is the length of a straight line from the point <m>(15,11,-2)</m> to
      <m>(20,15,-1)</m>.

            In this exercise we explore how to find the osculating circle for a given curve. As an example, we will use the curve defined by <m>f(x) = x^2</m>. Recall that this curve can be parameterized by <m>x(t) = t</m> and <m>y(t)=t^2</m>.

                  To find the center of the osculating circle, we will want to find a vector that points from a point on the curve to the center of the circle. Such a vector will be orthogonal to the tangent vector at that point. Recall that <m>\vT(s) = \langle \cos(\phi(s)), \sin(\phi(s)) \rangle</m>, where <m>\phi</m> is the angle the tangent vector to the curve makes with a horizontal vector. Use this fact to show that 
                  <me> \vT \cdot \frac{dT}{ds} = 0.

                  Explain why this tells us that <m>\frac{dT}{ds}</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vT</m>. Let <m>\vN</m> be the unit vector in the direction of <m>\frac{dT}{ds}</m>. The vector <m>\vN</m> is called the <em>principal unit normal vector</em><idx><h>principal unit normal vector</h></idx> and points in the direction toward which the curve is turning. The vector <m>\vN</m> also points toward the center of the osculating circle.

        <introduction>
          <p>
      In this section, we will study limits of
      functions of several variables, with a focus on limits of functions
      of two variables. In single variable calculus, we studied the notion of limit, which turned out to be a critical
      concept that formed the basis for the derivative and the definite
      integral. In this section we will begin to understand how the concept
      of limit for functions of two variables is similar to what we
      encountered for functions of a single variable.
      The limit will again be the fundamental
      idea in multivariable calculus, and we will use this notion of the limit
      of a function of several variables to define the important concept of
      differentiability later in this chapter. We have already seen its use in the derivatives of vector-valued functions in <xref ref="S-9-7-Vector-Valued-Functions-Derivatives">Section</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Let's begin by reviewing what we mean by the
      limit of a function of one variable. We say that a function <m>f</m> has a limit <m>L</m> as
      <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> provided that we can make the values <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like
      by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close (but not equal) to <m>a</m>. We denote this behavior by writing
      <me>
        \lim_{x\to a}f(x) = L.
      </me>
    </p>
          <exploration xml:id="PA_10_1">

          <title>Limits of Functions of Two Variables</title>
          <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_10_1">Preview Activity</xref>, we recalled the notion of limit
      from single variable calculus and saw that a similar concept applies
      to functions of two variables.
      Though we will focus on functions of two variables, for the sake of
      discussion, all the ideas we establish here are valid for functions of
      any number of variables. In a natural followup to our work in <xref ref="PA_10_1">Preview Activity</xref>,
      we now formally define what it means for a function of two variables to have a
      limit at a point.

          Given a function <m>f = f(x,y)</m>, we say that <m>f</m>

          sufficiently close (but not equal) to <m>(a,b)</m>. We write

      To investigate the limit of a single variable function, <m>\lim_{x\to
        a}f(x)</m>, we often consider the behavior of <m>f</m> as <m>x</m> approaches
      <m>a</m> from the right and from the left. Similarly, we may investigate
      limits of two-variable functions, <m>\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y)</m> by
      considering the behavior of <m>f</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(a,b)</m> from
      various directions. This situation is more complicated because there
      are infinitely many ways in which <m>(x,y)</m> may approach <m>(a,b)</m>. In the next activity, we
      see how it is important to consider a variety of those paths in investigating whether or not a limit exists.

      This activity shows that we need to be careful when studying the limit of a two-variable functions by considering its behavior along different paths. If we find two different paths that result in two different limits, then we may conclude that the limit does not exist. However, we can never conclude that the limit of a function exists only by considering its behavior along different paths.
    </p>
          <p>
      Generally speaking, concluding that a limit
      <m>\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y)</m> exists requires a more careful argument. 
    </p>
          <example xml:id="A_10_1_Limit_exists">
            <p>
      Consider the function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2}.
      </me>
      We want to know  whether <m>\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)</m> exists.
    </p>
            <p>
      Note that if either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is 0, then <m>f(x,y) = 0</m>. Therefore, if
      <m>f</m> has a limit at <m>(0,0)</m>, it must be 0. We will therefore argue
      that
      <me>
        \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y) = 0,
      </me>
      by showing that we can make <m>f(x,y)</m> as close to <m>0</m> as we wish by taking <m>(x,y)</m> sufficiently close (but not equal) to <m>(0,0)</m>. In what follows, we view <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as being real numbers that are close, but not equal, to 0.
    </p>
            <p>
      Since <m>0 \leq x^2</m>, we have
      <me>
        y^2 \leq x^2+y^2,
      </me>
      which implies that
      <me>
        \frac{y^2}{x^2+y^2} \leq 1.
      </me>
    </p>
            <p>
      Multiplying both sides by <m>x^2</m> and observing that <m>f(x,y) \ge 0</m> for all <m>(x,y)</m> gives
      <me>
        0\leq f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2} =
        x^2\left(\frac{y^2}{x^2+y^2}\right) \leq x^2.
      </me>
    </p>
            <p>
      Thus, <m> 0 \leq f(x,y) \leq x^2</m>. Since <m>x^2 \to 0</m> as <m>x \to 0</m>, we can make <m>f(x,y)</m> as close to <m>0</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>0</m> (for this example, it turns out that we don't even need to worry about making <m>y</m> close to 0). Therefore,
      <me>
        \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2} = 0.

      In spite of the fact that these two most recent examples
      illustrate some of the complications that arise when studying limits of two-variable functions, many of the properties that are familiar from our study of single variable functions hold in precisely the same way.

      We can use these properties and results from single variable calculus to verify that many limits exist. For example, these properties show that the function <m>f</m>
      defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = 3x^2y^3 + 2xy^2 - 3x + 1
      </me>
      has a limit at every point <m>(a,b)</m> and, moreover,

      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      The reason for this is that polynomial functions of a single variable have limits at every point.

      - 3x + 1</m> is continous at every point. And just as with single variable functions, continuity has certain
      properties that are based on the properties of limits.

            <p>
      Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be functions of two variables that are continuous at the point <m>(a,b)</m>. Then
      <ol><li>
          <p>
            <m>cf</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m> for any scalar <m>c</m>

        </li><li>
          <p>
            <m>f+g</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m>
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <m>f-g</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m>
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <m>fg</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m>
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <m>\frac{f}{g}</m> is continuous at <m>(a,b)</m> if <m>g(a,b) \neq 0</m>
          </p>
        </li></ol>
    </p>
          </assemblage>
          <p>
      Using these properties, we can apply results from single variable calculus
      to decide about continuity of multivariable functions. For example, the coordinate functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = x</m> and <m>g(x,y) = y</m> are continuous at every point. We can then use properties of continuity listed to conclude that every polynomial function in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is continuous at every point. For example, <m>g(x,y)=x^2</m> and <m>h(x,y)=y^3</m> are continuous functions, so their product <m>f(x,y) = x^2y^3</m> is a continuous multivariable function.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      We want to show that <m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches
      <m>(0,0)</m>.




      <alert>(a)</alert>
      If <m>(x,y)</m> tends to <m>(0,0)</m> along the curve
      <m>y = 4 x</m>, then
      <me>f(x,y) = f(x,4 x) = \frac{6x-4x}{x+4x} = \frac{2}{5}.</me>

      Therefore
      <me>\lim_{x\to0} f(x,4 x) = \frac{2}{5}.</me><alert>(b)</alert>
      Similarly, if <m>(x,y)</m> tends to <m>(0,0)</m> along the curve
      <m>y = 5 x</m>, then
      <me>f(x,y) = f(x,5 x) = \frac{6x-5x}{x+5x} = \frac{1}{6},</me>

      and so
      <me>\lim_{x\to0} f(x,5 x) = \frac{1}{6}.</me>




      Because we have two different values for these limits, we know that
      the function doesn't have a limit at <m>(0,0)</m>.  No matter how close
      we are to the origin, there will be points on <m>f(x,y)</m> that are close
      to <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> and points that are close to <m>\frac{1}{6}</m>, whereas for the
      limit to exist the function must get close to a single value.




      <alert>(c)</alert>
      We can see this more generally by considering the limit as <m>(x,y)</m>
      tends to <m>(0,0)</m> along the curve <m>y = m x</m>. Then
      <me>f(x,y) = f(x,m x) = \frac{6-m}{1+m},</me>
      so that
      <me>\lim_{x\to0} f(x,m x) = \frac{6-m}{1+m},</me>
      and we see for every different value of <m>m</m> we will get a different
      limiting value for the function.  Thus the function does not have a
      limit at <m>(0,0)</m>.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      Let us suppose that <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(0,0)</m> along the line <m>y=x</m>.
      Then
      <me>f(x,y) = f(x,x) = \frac{x^4}{x^{6} + x^3} = \frac{x}{x^3+1}.</me>
      Therefore
      <me>\lim_{^{(x,y)\to(0,0)}_{y=x}} f(x,y) = \lim_{x\to0} \frac{x}{x^3+1} =
      0.</me><alert>(b)</alert>
      On the other hand, if <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(0,0)</m> along the curve
      <m>y=x^3</m> we have
      <me>f(x,y)=f(x,x^3) = \frac{x^{6}}{x^{6} + x^{9}} = 1</me>
      and so
      <me>\lim_{^{(x,y)\to(0,0)}_{y=x^3}} f(x,y) = \lim_{x\to0}f(x,x^3) = 1.</me>





      Thus no matter how close they are to the origin, there will be points
      <m>(x,y)</m> such that <m>f(x,y)</m> is close to 0 and points <m>(x,y)</m> such
      that <m>f(x,y)</m> is close to <m>1</m>.  So the limit
      <me>\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)} f(x,y)</me>
      does not exist.

        <introduction>
          <p>
      The derivative plays a central role in first semester calculus
      because it provides important information about a function. Thinking
      graphically, for instance, the derivative at a point tells us the
      slope of the tangent line to the graph at that point. In addition, the
      derivative at a point also provides the instantaneous rate of change of
      the function with respect to changes in the independent variable.
    </p>
          <p>
      Now that we are investigating functions of two or more variables, we can still ask how fast the function is changing, though we have to be careful about what we mean. Thinking
      graphically again, we can try to measure how steep the graph of the function is in a particular direction. Alternatively, we may want to know how fast a function's output changes in response to a change in one of the inputs. Over the next few sections, we will develop tools for addressing issues such as these these. Preview

        <subsection>
          <title>First-Order Partial Derivatives</title>
          <p>
      In <xref ref="S-9-1-Functions">Section</xref>, we studied the behavior
      of a function of two or more variables by considering the <em>traces</em>
      of the function. Recall that in one example, we considered the function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{32},
      </me>
      which measures the range, or horizontal distance, in feet, traveled by a
      projectile launched with an initial
      speed of <m>x</m> feet per second at an angle <m>y</m> radians to the
      horizontal. The graph of this function is given again on the left in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_y">Figure</xref>. Moreover, if we fix the angle <m>y = 0.6</m>, we may view the trace <m>f(x,0.6)</m> as a
      function of <m>x</m> alone, as seen at right in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_y">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_10_2_trace_y">
            <caption>Left: The trace of <m>z=\frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{32}</m> with <m>y = 0.6</m>.</caption>
            <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
              <image source="images/fig_10_2_trace_y_a"/>
              <image source="images/fig_10_2_trace_y"/>
            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      Since the trace is a one-variable function, we may consider its
      derivative just as we did in the first semester of calculus. With
      <m>y=0.6</m>, we have
      <me>
        f(x,0.6) = \frac{\sin(1.2)}{32}x^2,
      </me>
      and therefore
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}[f(x,0.6)] = \frac{\sin(1.2)}{16}x.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      When <m>x=150</m>, this gives
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx}[f(x,0.6)]|_{x=150} = \frac{\sin(1.2)}{16}150 \approx
        8.74~\mbox{feet per feet per second} ,
      </me>
      which gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right of <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_y">Figure</xref>. Thinking of this derivative as an instantaneous
      rate of change implies that if we increase the initial speed of the projectile by
      one foot per second, we expect the horizontal distance traveled to
      increase by approximately 8.74 feet if we hold the launch angle constant at <m>0.6</m> radians.
    </p>
          <p>
      By holding <m>y</m> fixed and differentiating with respect to <m>x</m>, we
      obtain the first-order <em>partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to
      <m>x</m></em>. Denoting this partial derivative as <m>f_x</m>, we have seen that
      <me>
        f_x(150, 0.6) = \frac{d}{dx}f(x,0.6)|_{x=150} = \lim_{h\to
          0}\frac{f(150+h, 0.6) - f(150, 0.6)}{h}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      More generally, we have
      <me>
        f_x(a,b) = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(a+h, b)-f(a,b)}{h},
      </me>
      provided this limit exists.
    </p>
          <p>
      In the same way, we may obtain a trace by setting, say, <m>x=150</m> as shown
      in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_x">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_10_2_trace_x">
            <caption>The trace of <m>z=\frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{32}</m> with <m>x = 150</m>.</caption>
            <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
              <image source="images/fig_10_2_trace_x_a"/>
              <image source="images/fig_10_2_trace_x"/>
            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      This gives
      <me>
        f(150, y) = \frac{150^2}{32}\sin(2y),
      </me>
      and therefore
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dy}[f(150,y)] = \frac{150^2}{16}\cos(2y).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      If we evaluate this quantity at <m>y=0.6</m>, we have
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dy}[f(150,y)]|_{y=0.6} = \frac{150^2}{16}\cos(1.2) \approx 509.5
        ~\mbox{feet per radian} .
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Once again, the derivative gives the slope of the tangent line shown
      on the right in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_x">Figure</xref>. Thinking of the
      derivative as an instantaneous rate of change, we expect that the
      range of the projectile increases by 509.5 feet for every radian we increase the launch angle
      <m>y</m> if we keep the initial speed of the projectile constant at 150 feet per second.
    </p>
          <p>
      By holding <m>x</m> fixed and differentiating with respect to <m>y</m>, we
      obtain the first-order <em>partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m></em>.
      As before, we denote this partial derivative as <m>f_y</m> and write
      <me>
        f_y(150, 0.6) = \frac{d}{dy}f(150,y)|_{y=0.6} = \lim_{h\to
          0}\frac{f(150, 0.6+h) - f(150, 0.6)}{h}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      As with the partial derivative with respect to <m>x</m>, we may express this quantity more generally at an arbitrary point <m>(a,b)</m>.
      To recap, we have now arrived at the formal definition of the first-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables.

          <p>
      As these examples show, each partial derivative at a point arises as
      the derivative of a one-variable function defined by fixing one of the
      coordinates. In addition, we may consider each partial derivative as defining a new
      function of the point <m>(x,y)</m>, just as the derivative <m>f'(x)</m> defines
      a new function of <m>x</m> in single-variable calculus. Due to the connection between one-variable
      derivatives and partial derivatives, we will often use Leibniz-style
      notation to denote partial derivatives by writing
      <me>
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a, b) = f_x(a,b),
        \ 
        \mbox{and} 
        \ 
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a, b) = f_y(a,b).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      To calculate the partial
      derivative <m>f_x</m>, we hold <m>y</m> fixed and thus we treat <m>y</m> as a
      constant. In Leibniz notation, observe that
      <me>
        \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (x) = 1
        \ 
        \mbox{and} 
        \ 
        \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(y) = 0.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      To see the contrast between how we calculate single variable derivatives and partial derivatives, and the difference between the notations <m>\frac{d}{dx}[ \ ]</m> and <m>\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[ \ ]</m>, observe that
      <md><mrow>\amp  \frac{d}{dx}[3x^2 - 2x + 3] = 3\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] - 2\frac{d}{dx}[x]
          + \frac{d}{dx}[3] = 3\cdot 2x - 2,</mrow><mrow>\mbox{and} \  \amp  \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x^2y - xy + 2y] =
          y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x^2] -
          y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x]
          + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[2y] = y\cdot 2x - y</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      Thus, computing partial derivatives is straightforward: we use the standard rules of single variable calculus, but do so while holding one (or more) of the variables constant.

          <title>Interpretations of First-Order Partial Derivatives</title>
          <p>
      Recall that the derivative of a single variable function has a
      geometric interpretation as the slope of the line tangent to the graph
      at a given point. Similarly, we have seen that the partial
      derivatives measure the slope of a line tangent to a trace of a
      function of two variables as shown in <xref ref="F_10_2_trace_tangent">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

          <p>
      Now we consider the first-order partial derivatives in context. Recall
      that the difference quotient <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m> for a function
      <m>f</m> of a single variable <m>x</m> at a point where <m>x=a</m> tells us the
      average rate of change of <m>f</m> over the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m>, while the
      derivative <m>f'(a)</m> tells us the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> at
      <m>x=a</m>.
      We can use these same concepts to
      explain the meanings of the partial derivatives in context.

          <title>Using tables and contours to estimate partial
      derivatives</title>
          <p>
      Remember that functions of two variables are often represented as either
      a table of data or a contour plot.
      In single variable calculus, we saw how we can use the difference
      quotient to approximate derivatives if, instead of an algebraic
      formula, we only know the value of the
      function at a few points.
      The same idea applies to partial derivatives.

        The wind chill, as frequently reported, is a measure of how cold it feels outside when
        the wind is blowing. In <xref ref="T_10_2_wind_chill">Table</xref>, the wind chill <m>w</m>, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, is a function of the wind speed <m>v</m>, measured in miles per hour, and the ambient air temperature <m>T</m>, also measured in degrees Fahrenheit. We thus view <m>w</m> as being of the form <m>w = w(v, T)</m>.

          If <m>f=f(x,y)</m> is a function of two variables, there are two first
            order partial derivatives of <m>f</m>: the partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m>,
          <me>
            \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) = f_x(x,y) = \lim_{h \to 0}
                  \frac{f(x+h,y) - f(x,y)}{h},
          </me>
          and the partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m>,
          <me>
            \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y) = f_y(x,y) = \lim_{h \to 0}
                  \frac{f(x,y+h) - f(x,y)}{h},
          </me>
          where each partial derivative exists only at those points <m>(x,y)</m> for which
                the limit exists.

      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          The partial derivative <m>f_x(a,b)</m> tells us the instantaneous rate of
              change of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m> at <m>(x,y) = (a,b)</m> when <m>y</m> is fixed at <m>b</m>.  Geometrically,
              the partial derivative <m>f_x(a,b)</m> tells us the slope of the line
              tangent to the <m>y=b</m> trace of the function <m>f</m> at the point
              <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m>.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <m>\partial P /\partial t</m>: The unit is dollars per month (dollars/month).
      This is the rate at which payments change as the number of months it
      takes to pay off the loan changes.  The sign is negative because
      payments decrease as the pay-off time increases.  Thus
      <m>\partial P /\partial t = -15</m> dollars/month.




      <m>\partial P /\partial r</m>: The unit is dollars per percentage point
      (dollars/percent).  This is the rate at which payments change as
      the interest rate changes.  The sign is positive because payments
      increase as the interest rate increases.  Thus
      <m>\partial P /\partial r = 25</m> dollars/percent.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      We have <m>f(18,6) = 93</m>.




      <alert>(a)</alert>
      Thus, to estimate <m>f_t(18,6)</m>, we can take
      <me>f_t(18,6) \approx \frac{f(18+2,6) - f(18-2,6)}{4} =
          \frac{90 - 95}{4} = -1.25.</me>
      Alternately, we could take either of the two one-sided difference
      quotients,
      <me>f_t(18,6) \approx \frac{f(18+2,6) - f(18,6)}{2} = -1.5</me>
      or
      <me>f_t(18,6) \approx \frac{f(18,6) - f(18-2,6)}{2} = -1.</me>
      In each case, the units of <m>f_t</m> are percent per month.  This says
      18 months after rats are exposed to a formaldehyde concentration
      of 6 ppm, the percent of rats surviving is decreasing at a rate of
      about -1.25 per month. In other words, during the 18 month,
      around an additional -1.25 percent of the rats will die.




      <alert>(b)</alert>
      Proceeding similarly to find <m>f_c(18,6)</m>, we have
      <me>f_c(18,6) \approx \frac{f(18,6+2) - f(18,6-2)}{4} =
          \frac{82 - 98}{4} = -1.23077,</me>
      or, with one-sided difference quotients,
      <me>f_c(18,6) \approx \frac{f(18,6+2) - f(18,6)}{2} = -1.22222</me>
      or
      <me>f_c(18,6) \approx \frac{f(18,6) - f(18,6-2)}{2} = -1.25.</me>
      These indicate that if the original concentration increases from 6
      by 1 ppm, the percent surviving after 18 months decreases by about
      1.23.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      The quantity <m>H_T(10,0.2)</m> is approximated by an
      difference quotient.
      The first partial derivative with respect to <m>T</m> is approximated  by
      <me>H_T(10,0.2) \approx { H(10+\Delta T, 0.2) - H(10, 0.2)\over \Delta T},</me>
      for small <m>\Delta T</m>.  We are free to choose <m>\Delta T</m> to find
      values from the figure we are given.  If we take <m>\Delta T = 10</m>,
      we get the approximation
      <me>H_T(10,0.2) \approx { H(20, 0.2) - H(10, 0.2)\over 10} \approx
      {190 - 240\over 10} = -5.</me>




      (Note that you may get a different answer if you read different values
      from the graph.)  The geometric meaning of the partial derivative
      <m>H_T(10,0.2)</m> that we just approximated is the slope of the
      curve shown in the figure in the text corresponding to <m>w = 0.2</m> at the point
      where <m>T= 10</m>.



      In practical terms, we have found that for fog at <m>10^\circ</m> C containing
      0.1 g water per m<m>{}^3</m> of fog, a <m>1^\circ</m> C increase in temperature
      will reduce the heat requirement for dissipating the fog by about
      1~calories per cubic meter of fog.




      <alert>(b)</alert>
      We can approximate values of <m>H(T,w)</m> from the figure, giving the
      table below:





      <sidebyside><tabular top="medium" bottom="medium" left="medium" right="medium"><row><cell><m>w =</m></cell><cell>0.1</cell><cell>0.2</cell><cell>0.3</cell><cell>0.4</cell></row><row><cell><m>T = 10</m></cell><cell>120</cell><cell>240</cell><cell>330</cell><cell>450</cell></row><row><cell><m>T = 20</m></cell><cell>100</cell><cell>190</cell><cell>260</cell><cell>350</cell></row><row><cell><m>T = 30</m></cell><cell>80</cell><cell>160</cell><cell>220</cell><cell>300</cell></row><row><cell><m>T = 40</m></cell><cell>70</cell><cell>130</cell><cell>200</cell><cell>280</cell></row></tabular></sidebyside>





      This lets us approximate, using a difference quotient, each of the
      derivatives indicated.  For <m>H_T(10,0.2)</m>, we have
      <me>H_T(10,0.2) \approx \frac{(190 - 240)}{10}
          = -5.</me>
      (We could, of course, use a left or central difference instead.)
      Similarly, we have:
      <me>H_T(20,0.2) \approx -3, H_T(10,w2) \approx -7,
         H_T(20,0.3) \approx -4.</me><alert>(c)</alert>
      Using our table of values, we can similarly calculate the partial derivatives
      with respect to <m>w</m>.  For <m>H_w(10,0.2)</m>, we have
      <me>H_w(10,0.2) \approx \frac{(330 - 240)}{0.1}
          = 900.</me>
      (We could, of course, use a left or central difference instead.)
      Similarly, we have:
      <me>H_w(20,0.2) \approx 700, H_w(10,w2) \approx 1200,
         H_w(20,0.3) \approx 900.</me></solution>

                  Often we are given certain graphical information about a function instead of a rule. We can use that information to approximate partial derivatives. For example, suppose that we are given a contour plot of the kinetic energy function (as in <xref ref="F_10_2_pd_contour">Figure</xref>) instead of a formula. Use this contour plot to approximate <m>f_x(4,5)</m> and <m>f_y(4,5)</m> as best you can. Compare to your calculations from earlier parts of this exercise.

      Recall that for a single-variable function <m>f</m>, the second derivative of <m>f</m> is defined to be the derivative of the first derivative. That is, <m>f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[f'(x)]</m>, which can be stated in terms of the limit definition of the derivative by writing
      <me>
        f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h) - f'(x)}{h}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      In what follows, we begin exploring the four different second-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables and seek to understand what these various derivatives tell us about the function's behavior.

      One aspect of this notation can be a little confusing. The notation
      <me>
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial
          y}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)
      </me>
      means that we first differentiate with respect to <m>x</m> and then with
      respect to <m>y</m>; this can be expressed in the alternate notation <m>f_{xy} = (f_x)_y</m>. However, to find the second partial derivative
      <me>
        f_{yx} = (f_y)_x
      </me>
      we first differentiate with respect to <m>y</m> and then <m>x</m>. This means
      that
      <me>
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x} = f_{xy}, 
        \ 
        \mbox{and} 
        \ 
        \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y} = f_{yx}.

          <p>
      Be sure to note carefully the difference between Leibniz notation and subscript notation and the order in which <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> appear in each. In addition, remember that anytime we compute a partial derivative, we hold constant the variable(s) other than the one we are differentiating with respect to.

      Furthermore, we remember that the second derivative of a function at a
      point provides us with information about the concavity of the function
      at that point. Since the unmixed second-order partial derivative
      <m>f_{xx}</m> requires us to hold <m>y</m> constant and differentiate twice with
      respect to <m>x</m>, we may simply view <m>f_{xx}</m> as the second derivative
      of a trace of <m>f</m> where <m>y</m> is fixed. As such, <m>f_{xx}</m> will measure
      the concavity of this trace.
    </p>
          <p>
      Consider, for example, <m>f(x,y) = \sin(x) e^{-y}</m>. <xref ref="F_10_3_fxx">Figure</xref> shows the graph of this function along with the
      trace given by <m>y=-1.5</m>. Also shown are three tangent lines to this
      trace, with increasing <m>x</m>-values from left to right among the three plots in <xref ref="F_10_3_fxx">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
      That the slope of the tangent line is decreasing as <m>x</m> increases is
      reflected, as it is in one-variable calculus, in the fact that the
      trace is concave down. Indeed, we see that <m>f_x(x,y)=\cos(x)e^{-y}</m> and so
      <m>f_{xx}(x,y)=-\sin(x)e^{-y} \lt  0</m>, since <m>e^{-y} &gt; 0</m> for all values of <m>y</m>, including <m>y = -1.5</m>.

We also see three different lines that are tangent to the trace of <m>f</m> in the <m>x</m> direction at values of <m>y</m> that are increasing from left to right in the figure. Write a couple of sentences that describe whether the slope of the tangent lines to this curve increase or decrease as <m>y</m> increases, and, after computing <m>f_{yy}(x,y)</m>, explain how this observation is related to the value of <m>f_{yy}(1.75,y)</m>.

              In <xref ref="F_10_3_fxy">Figure</xref>, we start to think about the mixed partial derivative, <m>f_{xy}</m>.  Here, we first hold <m>y</m> constant to generate the first-order partial derivative <m>f_x</m>, and then we hold <m>x</m> constant to compute <m>f_{xy}</m>.  This leads to first thinking about a trace with <m>x</m> being constant, followed by slopes of tangent lines in the <m>y</m>-direction that slide along the original trace.

      As we have found in <xref ref="A_10_3_2a">Activities</xref> and <xref ref="A_10_3_6"/>, we may think of <m>f_{xy}</m> as measuring the
      <q>twist</q> of the graph as we increase <m>y</m> along a particular trace where <m>x</m> is held constant. In the same way, <m>f_{yx}</m> measures how
      the graph twists as we increase <m>x</m>. If we remember that Clairaut's
      theorem tells us that <m>f_{xy} = f_{yx}</m>, we see that the amount of
      twisting is the same in both directions. This twisting is perhaps
      more easily seen in <xref ref="F_10_3_ruled">Figure</xref>, which shows the graph
      of <m>f(x,y) = -xy</m>, for which <m>f_{xy} = -1</m>.

          <ul>
            <li>
        <p>
          There are four second-order partial derivatives of a function
            <m>f</m> of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>:
          <me>
            f_{xx} = (f_x)_x,
              f_{xy} = (f_x)_y,
              f_{yx} = (f_y)_x,\ \mbox{and}  \ 
              f_{yy} = (f_y)_y.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          The unmixed second-order partial derivatives, <m>f_{xx}</m> and
              <m>f_{yy}</m>, tell us about the concavity of the traces. The mixed second-order partial derivatives, <m>f_{xy}</m> and
              <m>f_{yx}</m>, tell us how the graph of <m>f</m> twists.

        <introduction>
          <p>
      One of the central concepts in single variable calculus is that the
      graph of a differentiable function, when viewed on a very small scale, looks like a
      line. We call this line the tangent line and measure its slope with
      the derivative. In this section, we will extend this concept to
      functions of several variables.
    </p>
          <p>
      Let's see what happens when we look
      at the graph of a two-variable function on a small scale. To begin, let's consider the function <m>f</m> defined by
      <me>
        f(x,y) = 6 - \frac{x^2}2 - y^2,
      </me>
      whose graph is shown in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_10_4_tangent_1">
            <caption>The graph of <m>f(x,y)=6-x^2/2 - y^2</m>.</caption>
            <image width="50%" source="images/fig_10_4_tangent_1"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      We choose to study the behavior of this function near the point <m>(x_0,
      y_0) = (1,1)</m>. In particular, we wish to view the graph on an
      increasingly small scale around this point, as shown in the two plots in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_2">Figure</xref>
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_10_4_tangent_2">
            <caption>The graph of <m>f(x,y)=6-x^2/2 - y^2</m>.</caption>
            <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
              <image source="images/fig_10_4_tangent_2"/>
              <image source="images/fig_10_4_tangent_3"/>
            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      Just as the graph of a differentiable single-variable function looks like a line
      when viewed on a small scale, we see that the graph of this particular two-variable
      function looks like a plane, as seen in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_4">Figure</xref>.
      In the following preview activity, we explore how to find the equation of this plane.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_10_4_tangent_4">
            <caption>The graph of <m>f(x,y)=6-x^2/2 - y^2</m>.</caption>
            <image width="50%" source="images/fig_10_4_tangent_4"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      In what follows, we will also use the important fact<fn>As we saw in <xref ref="S-9-5-Lines-Planes">Section</xref>, the equation
        of a plane passing through the point <m>(x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> may be written
        in the form <m>A(x-x_0) + B(y-y_0) + C(z-z_0) = 0</m>.  If the
        plane is not vertical, then <m>C\neq 0</m>, and we can
        rearrange this and hence write
      <m>C(z-z_0) = -A(x-x_0) - B(y-y_0)</m>
      and thus
      <md><mrow>z \amp  = z_0-\frac AC(x-x_0) - \frac BC(y-y_0)</mrow><mrow>\amp  = z_0 + a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0)</mrow></md>
      where <m>a=-A/C</m> and <m>b=-B/C</m>, respectively.</fn> that the plane passing through <m>(x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> may be expressed in the form
      <m>z = z_0 + a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0)</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants.

        <subsection>
          <title>The Tangent Plane</title>
          <p>
      Before stating the formula for the equation of the tangent plane at a point for a general function <m>f=f(x,y)</m>, we need to discuss a technical
      condition. As we have noted, when we look at the graph of a single-variable
      function on a small scale near a point <m>x_0</m>, we expect to see a line;
      in this case, we say that <em><m>f</m> is locally linear near <m>x_0</m></em> since the graph looks like a linear function locally around <m>x_0</m>. Of course, there are functions, such as the absolute value function given by <m>f(x)=|x|</m>, that are not locally linear at every point. In single-variable calculus, we learn that if the derivative of a function exists at a point, then the function is guaranteed to be locally linear there.
    </p>
          <p>
      In a similar way, we say that a two-variable function <em><m>f</m> is locally linear<idx><h>function</h><h>locally linear</h></idx> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m></em> provided that the graph of <m>f</m> looks like a plane (its <em>tangent plane</em>) when viewed on a small scale near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. How can we tell when a function of two variables is locally linear at a point?
    </p>
          <p>
      It is not unreasonable to expect that if <m>f_x(a,b)</m> and <m>f_y(a,b)</m> exist for some function <m>f</m> at a point <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is locally linear at <m>(a,b)</m>. This is not sufficient, however. As an example, consider the function <m>f</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = x^{1/3} y^{1/3}</m>. In <xref ref="Ez_10_4_0">Exercise</xref> you are asked to show that <m>f_x(0,0)</m> and <m>f_y(0,0)</m> both exist, but that <m>f</m> is not locally linear at <m>(0,0)</m> (see <xref ref="F_10_4_Not_diff">Figure</xref>). So the existence of the two first order partial derivatives at a point does not guarantee local linearity at that point.

      It would take us too far afield to provide a rigorous dicussion of differentiability of functions of more than one variable (see <xref ref="Ez_10_4_4">Exercise</xref> for a little more detail), so we will be content to define stronger, but more easily verified, conditions that ensure local linearity.

      If <m>f</m> is a function of the independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and both <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then <m>f</m> is <em>continuously differentiable</em><idx><h>function</h><h>continuously differentiable</h></idx> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.

      As a consequence, whenever a function <m>z = f(x,y)</m> is continuously differentiable at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, it follows that the function has a tangent plane at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. Viewed up close, the tangent plane and the function are then virtually indistinguishable. (We won't formally define differentiability of multivariable functions here, and for our purposes continuous differentiability is the only condition we will ever need to use. It is important to note that continuous differentiability is a stronger condition than differentiability. All of the results we encounter will apply to differentiable functions, and so also apply to continuously differentiable functions.)  In addition, as in <xref ref="PA_10_4">Preview Activity</xref>, we find the following general formula for the tangent plane.

        <em>Important Note:</em> As can be seen in <xref ref="Ez_10_4_0">Exercise</xref>, it is possible that <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>f_y(x_0,y_0)</m> can exist for a function <m>f</m>, and so the plane <m>z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)</m> exists even though <m>f</m> is not locally linear at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> (because the graph of <m>f</m> does not look linear when we zoom in around the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>). In such a case this plane is not tangent to the graph. Differentiability for a function of two variables implies the existence of a tangent plane, but the existence of the two first order partial derivatives of a function at a point does not imply differentiaility. This is quite different than what happens in single variable calculus.

      Finally, one important note about the form of the equation for the tangent plane, <m>z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)</m>. Say, for example, that we have the particular tangent plane <m>z = 7 - 2(x-3) + 4(y+1)</m>. Observe that we can immediately read from this form that <m>f_x(3,-1) = -2</m> and <m>f_y(3,-1) = 4</m>; furthermore, <m>f_x(3,-1)=-2</m> is the slope of the trace to both <m>f</m> and the tangent plane in the <m>x</m>-direction at <m>(-3,1)</m>. In the same way, <m>f_y(3,-1) = 4</m> is the slope of the trace of both <m>f</m> and the tangent plane in the <m>y</m>-direction at <m>(3,-1)</m>.

          <title>Linearization</title>
          <p>
      In single variable calculus, an important use of the tangent line is
      to approximate the value of a differentiable function. Near the point <m>x_0</m>, the
      tangent line to the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>x_0</m> is close to the
      graph of <m>f</m> near <m>x_0</m>, as shown in <xref ref="F_10_4_2d_linear">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_10_4_2d_linear">
            <caption>The linearization of the single-variable function <m>f(x)</m>.</caption>

            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      In this single-variable setting, we let <m>L</m> denote the function whose graph is the tangent line, and thus
      <me>
        L(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0)
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Furthermore, observe that <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m> near <m>x_0</m>. We call <m>L</m> the
      <em>linearization</em> of <m>f</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      In the same way, the tangent plane to the graph of a differentiable function <m>z = f(x,y)</m> at a point
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provides a good approximation of <m>f(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0,
      y_0)</m>. Here, we define the linearization, <m>L</m>, to be the two-variable function whose
      graph is the tangent plane, and thus
      <me>
        L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) +
        f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Finally, note that <m>f(x,y)\approx L(x,y)</m> for points near <m>(x_0,
      y_0)</m>. This is illustrated in <xref ref="F_10_4_tangent_9">Figure</xref>.

          <title>Differentials</title>
          <p>
      As we have seen, the linearization <m>L(x,y)</m> enables us to estimate the value of <m>f(x,y)</m> for points <m>(x,y)</m> near the base point
      <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>.
      Sometimes, however, we are more interested in the <em>change</em> in <m>f</m> as we move from the base point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to another
      point <m>(x,y)</m>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_10_4_differential">

          </figure>
          <p>
      <xref ref="F_10_4_differential">Figure</xref> illustrates this situation. Suppose
      we are at the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, and we know the value <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m> of <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. If we consider the displacement <m>\langle \Delta x, \Delta
      y\rangle</m> to a new point <m>(x,y) = (x_0+\Delta x, y_0
      + \Delta y)</m>, we would like to know how much the function has changed.
      We denote this change by <m>\Delta f</m>, where
      <me>
        \Delta f = f(x,y) - f(x_0, y_0).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      A simple way to estimate the change <m>\Delta f</m> is to approximate it by
      <m>df</m>, which represents the change in the linearization <m>L(x,y)</m> as we move from
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m>. This gives
      <md><mrow>\Delta f \approx df \amp = L(x,y)-f(x_0, y_0)</mrow><mrow>\amp = [f(x_0,y_0)+ f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) +

    </p>
          <p>
      For consistency, we will denote the
      change in the independent variables as <m>dx = \Delta x</m> and <m>dy =
      \Delta y</m>, and thus
      <men xml:id="E_10_4_differential">

      </men>
    </p>
          <p>
      Expressed equivalently in Leibniz notation, we have

      and <xref ref="E_10_4_differential_leib"/> express the
      relationship between these changes. Equation
      <xref ref="E_10_4_differential_leib"/> resembles an important idea
      from single-variable calculus: when <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>,
      it follows in the notation of differentials that
      <me>
        dy = y'~dx = \frac{dy}{dx}~dx.

    </p>
          <p>
      We will illustrate the use of differentials with an
      example. 
    </p>
          <example>
            <p>
      Suppose we have a machine that manufactures rectangles of
      width <m>x=20</m> cm and height <m>y=10</m> cm. However, the machine isn't perfect, and therefore the width could be off by <m>dx = \Delta x = 0.2</m> cm and the height could be off by <m>dy = \Delta y = 0.4</m> cm.
    </p>
            <p>
      The area of the rectangle is
      <me>
        A(x,y) = xy,
      </me>
      so that the area of a perfectly manufactured rectangle is <m>A(20, 10) =
      200</m> square centimeters. Since the machine isn't perfect, we would
      like to know how much the area of a given manufactured rectangle could differ from the
      perfect rectangle. We will estimate the uncertainty in the area using
      <xref ref="E_10_4_differential"/>, and find that
      <me>
        \Delta A \approx dA = A_x(20, 10)~dx + A_y(20,10)~dy.
      </me>
    </p>
            <p>
      Since <m>A_x = y</m> and <m>A_y = x</m>, we have
      <me>
        \Delta A \approx dA = 10~dx + 20~dy = 10\cdot0.2 + 20\cdot0.4 = 10.
      </me>
    </p>
            <p>
      That is, we estimate that the area in our rectangles could be off by
      as much as 10 square centimeters.

        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of two independent variables is locally linear at
            a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> if the graph of <m>f</m> looks like a plane 
            as we zoom in on the graph around the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.  In this
            case, the equation of the tangent plane is given by
          <me>
            z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          The tangent plane <m>L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)</m>, when considered as a function, is
            called the linearization of a differentiable function <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and may be used
            to estimate values of <m>f(x,y)</m>;  that is, <m>f(x,y) \approx L(x,y)</m>
            for points <m>(x,y)</m> near <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> of two independent variables is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> provided that both <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> exist and are continuous in an open disk containing 
          the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          The differential <m>df</m> of a function <m>f= f(x,y)</m> is related to the
            differentials <m>dx</m> and <m>dy</m> by
          <me>
            df = f_x(x_0,y_0) dx + f_y(x_0,y_0)dy.
          </me>
          We can use this relationship to
            approximate small changes in <m>f</m> that result from small changes in
            <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a),(b)</alert>
      The two tables of values are shown below





      <sidebyside><tabular top="medium" bottom="medium" left="medium" right="medium"><row><cell><m>x =</m></cell><cell>0.9</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>1.1</cell></row><row><cell><m>y = 1.4</m></cell><cell>0.0691</cell><cell>0.0625</cell><cell>0.0566</cell></row><row><cell><m>y = 1.5</m></cell><cell>0.0288</cell><cell>0.026</cell><cell>0.0235</cell></row><row><cell><m>y = 1.6</m></cell><cell>-0.0119</cell><cell>-0.0107</cell><cell>-0.0097</cell></row></tabular></sidebyside><sidebyside><tabular top="medium" bottom="medium" left="medium" right="medium"><row><cell><m>x =</m></cell><cell>0.99</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>1.01</cell></row><row><cell><m>y = 1.49</m></cell><cell>0.03</cell><cell>0.0297</cell><cell>0.0294</cell></row><row><cell><m>y = 1.5</m></cell><cell>0.0263</cell><cell>0.026</cell><cell>0.0258</cell></row><row><cell><m>y = 1.51</m></cell><cell>0.0226</cell><cell>0.0224</cell><cell>0.0221</cell></row></tabular></sidebyside>



      Both tables are nearly linear. To check this, observe that the
      increments in each row (column) are equal, or nearly so.  The
      second table is more linear due to finer data.




      <alert>(c)</alert>
      From either table we see that <m>f(1,1.5)\approx 0.026</m>.
      Also, using the second table,
      <me>f_x(1,1.5) \approx \frac{f(1.01,1.5) - f(0.99,1.5)}{.02} =
      	\frac{0.0258 - 0.0263}{0.02} = -0.025,</me><me>f_y(1,1.5) \approx \frac{f(1,1.51) - f(1,1.49)}{.02} =
      	\frac{0.0224 - 0.0297}{0.02} = -0.365.</me>
      Using these estimates for the partial derivatives, we get that the
      local linearization of <m>f</m> around <m>(1,1.5)</m> is
      <me>f(x,y) \approx f(1,1.5)+f_x(1,1.5)(x-1)+f_y(1,1.5)(y-1.5)
      	= 0.026 + (-0.025)(x - 1) + (-0.365)(y - 1.5).</me>



      Now we use <m>f_x = -e^{-x}\cos\!\left(y\right)</m> and <m>f_y = -e^{-x}\sin\!\left(y\right)</m>, giving
      <me>f_x(1,1.5) = -0.0260228,
      f_y(1,1.5) = -0.366958,</me>
      we have the local linearization of <m>f</m> around <m>(1,1.5)</m><me>f(x,y) \approx 0.0260228+\left(-0.0260228\right)\!\left(x-1\right)+\left(-0.366958\right)\!\left(y-1.5\right).</me>
      Note that these agree to a reasonable number of decimal places.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      Since <m>z</m> is a linear function of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> with slope -5 in the
      <m>x</m> direction, and slope 5 in the <m>y</m> direction, we have:
      <me>z = -5 x + 5 y + c.</me>
      We can write an equation for changes in <m>z</m> in terms of changes
      in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>:
      <me>\Delta z = (-5 (x + \Delta x) + 5(y + \Delta y) + c) -
          (-5 x + 5 y + c) = -5 \Delta x + 5 \Delta y.</me>
      Since <m>\Delta x = 0.2</m> and <m>\Delta y = 0.5</m>, we have
      <me>\Delta z = -5 (0.2) + 5(0.5) = 1.5.</me>
      So a <m>0.2</m> change in <m>x</m> and a <m>0.5</m> change in <m>y</m>
      produces a <m>1.5</m> change in <m>z</m>.



      <alert>(b)</alert>
      As we know that <m>z=6</m> when <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=2</m>, the value of
      <m>z</m> when <m>x=2.7</m> and <m>y=1.9</m> will be
      <me>z = 6 + \Delta z = 6  - 5\Delta x + 5\Delta y.</me>
      where <m>\Delta z</m> is the change in <m>z</m> when <m>x</m> changes from 3
      to 2.7 and <m>y</m> changes from 2 to 1.9. We have
      <m>\Delta x = 2.7 - 3 = -0.3</m> and <m>\Delta y = 1.9 - 2 = -0.1</m>.
      Therefore, when <m>x=2.7</m> and <m>y=1.9</m>, we have
      <me>z = 6  - 5 \cdot(-0.3) + 5\cdot(-0.1) = 7.</me></solution>

                  Just as we can find a local linearization for a differentiable function of two variables, we can do so for functions of three or more variables.  By extending the concept of the local linearization from two to three variables, find the linearization of the function <m>h(x,y,z) =

            In this section we argued that if <m>f = f(x,y)</m> is a function of two variables and if <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> both exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. This condition ensures that <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, but it does not define what it means for <m>f</m> to be differentiable at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. In this exercise we explore the definition of differentiability of a function of two variables in more detail. Throughout, let <m>g</m> be the function defined by <m>g(x,y)=  \sqrt{|xy|}</m>.

                  Recall that if a function <m>f = f(x)</m> of a single variable is differentiable at <m>x=x_0</m>, then 
                  <me>f'(x_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}</me>
                  exists. We saw in single variable calculus that the existence of <m>f'(x_0)</m> means that the graph of <m>f</m> is locally linear at <m>x=x_0</m>. In other words, the graph of <m>f</m> looks like its linearization <m>L(x) = f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)</m> for <m>x</m> close to <m>x_0</m>. That is, the values of <m>f(x)</m> can be closely approximated by <m>L(x)</m> as long as <m>x</m> is close to <m>x_0</m>. We can measure how good the approximation of <m>L(x)</m> is to <m>f(x)</m> with the error function 
                  <me>E(x) = L(x) - f(x) = f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0) - f(x).</me>
                  As <m>x</m> approaches <m>x_0</m>, <m>E(x)</m> approaches <m>f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(0) - f(x_0) = 0</m>, and so <m>L(x)</m> provides increasingly better approximations to <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer to <m>x_0</m>. 

                  Show that, even though <m>g(x,y) = \sqrt{|xy|}</m> is not locally linear at <m>(0,0)</m>, its error term
                  <me>E(x,y) = L(x,y) - g(x,y)</me>
                  at <m>(0,0)</m> has a limit of <m>0</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(0,0)</m>. (Use the linearization you found in part (b).) This shows that just because an error term goes to <m>0</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, we cannot conclude that a function is locally linear at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.

                <p>
                  As the previous part illustrates, having the error term go to <m>0</m> does not ensure that a function of two variables is locally linear. Instead, we need a notation of a relative error. To see how this works, let us return to the single variable case for a moment and consider <m>f = f(x)</m> as a function of one variable. If we let <m>x = x_0+h</m>, where <m>|h|</m> is the distance from <m>x</m> to <m>x_0</m>, then the relative error in approximating <m>f(x_0+h)</m> with <m>L(x_0+h)</m> is  
                  <me>\frac{E(x_0+h)}{h}.</me>
                  Show that, for a function <m>f = f(x)</m> of a single variable, the limit of the relative error is <m>0</m> as <m>h</m> approaches <m>0</m>.

                  Even though the error term for a function of two variables might have a limit of <m>0</m> at a point, our example shows that the function may not be locally linear at that point. So we use the concept of relative error to define differentiability of a function of two variables. When we consider differentiability of a function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, then if <m>x = x_0+h</m> and <m>y = y_0+k</m>, the distance from <m>(x,y)</m> to <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is <m>\sqrt{h^2+k^2}</m>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
      In single-variable calculus, we encountered situations in
      which some quantity <m>z</m> depends on <m>y</m> and, in turn, <m>y</m> depends on
      <m>x</m>. A change in <m>x</m> produces a change in <m>y</m>, which consequently
      produces a change in <m>z</m>. Using the language of differentials that we saw
      in the previous section, these changes are naturally related by
      <me>
        dz = \frac{dz}{dy}~dy 
        \ 
        \mbox{and} 
        \ 
        dy = \frac{dy}{dx}~dx.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      In terms of instantaneous rates of change, we then have
      <me>
        dz = \frac{dz}{dy}\frac{dy}{dx}~dx = \frac{dz}{dx}~dx
      </me>
      and thus
      <me>
        \frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy}\frac{dy}{dx}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      This most recent equation we call the <em>Chain Rule</em>.
    </p>
          <p>
      In the case of a function <m>f</m> of two variables where <m>z = f(x,y)</m>, it might be that both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> depend on another variable <m>t</m>. A change in <m>t</m> then produces changes in both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, which then cause <m>z</m> to change. In this section we will see how to find the change in <m>z</m> that is caused by a change in <m>t</m>, leading us to multivariable versions of the Chain Rule involving both regular and partial derivatives.

          <title>The Chain Rule</title>
          <p>
      As <xref ref="PA_10_3">Preview Activity</xref> suggests, the following version of the Chain Rule holds in general.
    </p>
          <assemblage xml:id="Chain-rule">
            <title>The Chain Rule</title>
            <p>
      Let <m>z = f(x,y)</m>, where <m>f</m> is a differentiable function of the independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> each be differentiable functions of an independent variable <m>t</m>. Then
      <men xml:id="E_10_5_chain_rule">
        \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt}.
      </men>
    </p>
          </assemblage>
          <p>
      It is important to note the differences among the derivatives in <xref ref="E_10_5_chain_rule"/>. Since <m>z</m> is a function of the two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, the derivatives in the Chain Rule for <m>z</m> with respect to <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are partial derivatives. However, since <m>x = x(t)</m> and <m>y = y(t)</m> are functions of the single variable <m>t</m>, their derivatives are the standard derivatives of functions of one variable. When we compose <m>z</m> with <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>, we then have <m>z</m> as a function of the single variable <m>t</m>, making the derivative of <m>z</m> with respect to <m>t</m> a standard derivative from single variable calculus as well.
    </p>
          <p>
      To understand why this Chain Rule works in general, suppose that some quantity <m>z</m> depends on <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> so
      that
      <men xml:id="E_10_5_1">
        dz = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}~dx + \frac{\partial z}{\partial
            y}~dy.
      </men>
    </p>
          <p>
      Next, suppose that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> each depend on another quantity <m>t</m>, so that
      <men xml:id="E_10_5_2">
        dx = \frac{dx}{dt}~dt
          \ 
          \mbox{and} 
          \ 
          dy = \frac{dy}{dt}~dt.
      </men>
    </p>
          <p>
      Combining Equations<nbsp/><xref ref="E_10_5_1"/> and <xref ref="E_10_5_2"/>, we find that
      <me>
        dz = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt}~dt 
        + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}~dt = \frac{dz}{dt}~dt,
      </me>
      which is the Chain Rule in this particular context, as expressed in <xref ref="E_10_5_chain_rule">Equation</xref>.

          <title>Tree Diagrams</title>
          <p>
      Up to this point, we have applied the Chain Rule to situations where
      we have a function <m>z</m> of variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, with both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> depending on another single
      quantity <m>t</m>. We may apply the Chain Rule, however, when <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> each
      depend on more than one quantity, or when <m>z</m> is a function of more than two variables. It can be challenging to keep track
      of all the dependencies among the variables, and thus a tree diagram can be a useful tool to organize our work.
      For example, suppose that <m>z</m> depends on <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
      both depend on <m>t</m>. We may represent these relationships using the tree
      diagram shown at left <xref ref="F_10_5_tree_1">Figure</xref>. We place the dependent
      variable at the top of the tree and connect it to the variables on
      which it depends one level below. We then connect each of those variables to the variable on which each depends.

      construct the product of the derivatives along all paths connecting
      the variables and then add all of these products.

          The Chain Rule is a tool for differentiating a composite for
            functions.  In its simplest form, it says that if <m>f(x,y)</m> is a
            function of two variables and <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> depend on <m>t</m>, then
          <me>
            \frac{df}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt}

      <answer><p><m>\cos\!\left(v^{2}\right)\cdot 2v</m></p></answer>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      Since <m>z</m> is a function of two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> which are
      functions of two variables <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>, the two chain rule identities
      which apply are:
      <me>\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}  = 
             \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}+
             \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}</me>
      and
      <me>\frac{\partial z}{\partial v} = 
             \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}+
             \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial v}</me>

      This problem is most easily solved by substitution:
      <me>z = \sin\!\left(\left(v\cos\!\left(u\right)\right)^{2}+\left(v\sin\!\left(u\right)\right)^{2}\right) = \sin\!\left(v^{2}\right)</me>
      so
      <me>\frac{\partial z}{\partial u} = 0,</me>
      and
      <me>\frac{\partial z}{\partial v} = \cos\!\left(v^{2}\right)\cdot 2v.</me>

      This problem can also be solved using the chain rule  but
      it is  more difficult.

            There are several proposed formulas to approximate the surface
            area of the human body.
            One model<fn>DuBois D, DuBois DF. A formula to
                 estimate the approximate surface area if height and weight be
                 known.  <em>Arch Int Med</em> 1916;17:863-71.</fn> uses the formula

            height in centimeters, and <m>w</m> is the weight in kilograms.
          </p>
              <p>
            Since a person's height <m>h</m> and weight <m>w</m> change over time,
            <m>h</m> and <m>w</m> are functions of time
            <m>t</m>. Let us think about what is happening to a child whose height
            is <m>60</m> centimeters and weight is <m>9</m> kilograms. Suppose,
            furthermore, that

              The partial derivatives of a function <m>f</m> tell us the rate of change of
                  <m>f</m> in the direction of the coordinate axes.  How can we measure
                  the rate of change of <m>f</m> in other directions?

        <introduction>
          <p>
      The partial derivatives of a function tell us the instantaneous rate at which the function changes as we hold all but one independent variable constant and allow the remaining independent variable to change. It is natural to wonder how we can measure the rate at which a function changes in directions other than parallel to a coordinate axes. In what follows, we investigate this question, and see how the rate of change in any given direction is connected to the rates of change given by the standard partial derivatives.

            <p>
        Let's consider the function <m>f</m> defined by
        <me>
          f(x,y) = 30 - x^2 - \frac 12 y^2,
        </me>
        and suppose that <m>f</m> measures the temperature, in degrees Celsius, at a given point in the plane, where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are measured in feet. Assume that the positive <m>x</m>-axis points due east, while the positive <m>y</m>-axis points due north. A contour plot of <m>f</m> is shown in <xref ref="F_10_6_preview_1">Figure</xref>

          <p>
            Suppose that a person is walking due east, and thus parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis.  At what instantaneous rate is the temperature changing with respect to <m>x</m> at the moment the walker passes the point <m>(2,1)</m>?  What are the units on this rate of change?
          </p>
        </li>
              <li>
          <p>
            Next, determine the instantaneous rate of change of temperature with respect to distance at the point <m>(2,1)</m> if the person is instead walking due north.  Again, include units on your result.
          </p>
        </li>
              <li>
          <p>
            Now, rather than walking due east or due north, let's suppose that the person is walking with velocity given by the vector <m>\vv = \langle 3, 4 \rangle</m>, where time is measured in seconds.  Note that the person's speed is thus <m>| \vv | = 5</m> feet per second.
  
              Find parametric equations for the person's path; that is, parameterize the line through <m>(2,1)</m> using the direction vector <m>\vv = \langle 3, 4 \rangle</m>.  Let <m>x(t)</m> denote the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the line, and <m>y(t)</m> its <m>y</m>-coordinate. Make sure your parameterization places the walker at the point <m>(2,1)</m> when <m>t=0</m>.

              <li>
          <p>
            With the parameterization in (c), we can now view the temperature <m>f</m> as not only a function of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, but also of time, <m>t</m>.  Hence, use the chain rule to determine the value of <m>\frac{df}{dt}\bigm|_{t=0}</m>.  What are the units on your answer?  What is the practical meaning of this result?

          <title>Directional Derivatives</title>
          <p>
      Given a function <m>z = f(x,y)</m>, the partial derivative <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> as only the <m>x</m> variable changes; likewise, <m>f_y(x_0,y_0)</m> measures the rate of change of <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> as only <m>y</m> changes. Note particularly that <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m> is measured in <q>units of <m>f</m> per unit of change in <m>x</m>,</q> and that the units on <m>f_y(x_0,y_0)</m> are similar.
    </p>
          <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_10_6">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw how we could measure the rate of change of <m>f</m> in a situation where both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> were changing; in that activity, however, we found that this rate of change was measured in <q>units of <m>f</m> per unit of <em>time</em>.</q> In a given unit of time, we may move more than one unit of distance. In fact, in <xref ref="PA_10_6">Preview Activity</xref>, in each unit increase in time we move a distance of <m>| \vv | = 5</m> feet. To generalize the notion of partial derivatives to any direction of our choice, we instead want to have a rate of change whose units are <q>units of <m>f</m> per unit of distance in the given direction.</q>
    </p>
          <p>
      In this light, in order to formally define the derivative in a particular direction of motion, we want to represent the change in <m>f</m> for a given <em>unit</em> change in the direction of motion. We can represent this unit change in direction with a unit vector, say <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m>. If we move a distance <m>h</m> in the direction of <m>\vu</m> from a fixed point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, we then arrive at the new point <m>(x_0+u_1h, y_0+u_2h)</m>. It now follows that the slope of the secant line to the curve on the surface through <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> in the direction of <m>\vu</m> through the points <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>(x_0+u_1h, y_0+u_2h)</m> is
      <men xml:id="eq_10_6_diff_quot">
        m_{\mbox{sec} } = \frac{f(x_0+u_1h, y_0+u_2h) - f(x_0,y_0)}{h}.
      </men>
    </p>
          <p>
      To get the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> in the direction <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m>, we must take the limit of the quantity in Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_10_6_diff_quot"/> as <m>h \to 0</m>. Doing so results in the formal definition of the directional derivative.
    </p>
          <definition>
            <statement>
              <p>
          Let <m>f = f(x,y)</m> be given. The <term>derivative of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(x,y)</m> in the direction of the unit vector <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m></term><idx><h>directional derivative</h></idx> is denoted <m>D_{\vu}f(x,y)</m> and is given by
          <men xml:id="E_DirDerDef">
            D_{\vu}f(x,y) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+u_1h, y+u_2h) - f(x,y)}{h}
          </men>
          for those values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> for which the limit exists.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
      The quantity <m>D_{\vu} f(x,y)</m> is called a <em>directional derivative</em>. When we evaluate the directional derivative <m>D_{\vu} f(x,y)</m> at a point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>, the result <m>D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0)</m> tells us the instantaneous rate at which <m>f</m> changes at <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> per unit increase in the direction of the vector <m>\vu</m>. In addition, the quantity <m>D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0)</m> tells us the slope of the line tangent to the surface in the direction of <m>\vu</m> at the point <m>(x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0))</m>.

        <subsection>
          <title>Computing the Directional Derivative</title>
          <p>
      In a similar way to how we developed shortcut rules for standard derivatives in single variable calculus, and for partial derivatives in multivariable calculus, we can also find a way to evaluate directional derivatives without resorting to the limit definition found in Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_DirDerDef"/>. We do so using a very similar approach to our work in <xref ref="PA_10_6">Preview Activity</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Suppose we consider the situation where we are interested in the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> in the direction <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m>, where <m>\vu</m> is a unit vector. The variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are therefore changing according to the parameterization
      <me>
        x = x_0 + u_1t \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \  y = y_0 + u_2t.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Observe that <m>\frac{dx}{dt} = u_1</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = u_2</m> for all values of <m>t</m>. Since <m>\vu</m> is a unit vector, it follows that a point moving along this line moves one unit of distance per one unit of time; that is, each single unit of time corresponds to movement of a single unit of distance in that direction. This observation allows us to use the Chain Rule to calculate the directional derivative, which measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> with respect to change in the direction <m>\vu</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      In particular, by the Chain Rule, it follows that
      <md><mrow>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) \amp = f_x(x_0,y_0)\frac{dx}{dt}\biggm|_{(x_0,y_0)} + f_y(x_0,y_0)\frac{dy}{dt}\biggm|_{(x_0,y_0)} </mrow><mrow> \amp = f_x(x_0,y_0)u_1 + f_y(x_0,y_0)u_2. </mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      This now allows us to compute the directional derivative at an arbitrary point according to the following formula.

          <title>The Gradient</title>
          <p>
      Via the Chain Rule, we have seen that for a given function <m>f = f(x,y)</m>, its instantaneous rate of change in the direction of a unit vector <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m> is given by
      <men xml:id="E_DDrevisited">
        D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = f_x(x_0,y_0)u_1 + f_y(x_0,y_0)u_2.

      Recalling that the dot product of two vectors <m>\vv = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle</m> and <m>\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle</m> is computed by
      <me>
        \vv \cdot \vu = v_1 u_1 + v_2 u_2,
      </me>
      we see that we may recast Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_DDrevisited"/> in a way
      that has geometric meaning. In particular, we see that <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0)</m> is the dot product of the vector <m>\left\langle f_x(x_0,y_0), f_y(x_0,y_0) \right\rangle</m> and the vector <m>\vu</m>.

      We call this
      vector formed by the partial derivatives of <m>f</m> the <em>gradient</em> of <m>f</m> and denote it

      As a vector, <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m> defines a direction and a length. As we will soon see, both

          <title>The Direction of the Gradient</title>
          <p>
      Remember that the dot product also conveys information about the angle
      between the two vectors. If <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\nabla
      f(x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>\vu</m> (where <m>\vu</m> is a unit vector),
      then we also have that
      <me>
        D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = \nabla f(x_0,y_0)\cdot\vu = |\nabla f(x_0,y_0)||\vu|
        \cos(\theta).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      In particular, when <m>\theta</m> is a right angle, as shown on the left of
      <xref ref="F_10_6_gradient_sign">Figure</xref>, then <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = 0</m>, because <m>\cos(\theta) = 0</m>. Since the value of the directional derivative is 0, this means that <m>f</m> is unchanging in this direction, and hence <m>\vu</m> must be tangent to the contour of <m>f</m> that passes through <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. In other words, <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m> is orthogonal to the
      contour through <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. This shows that the gradient vector at a given point is always perpendicular to the contour passing through the point, confirming that what we saw in part (c) of <xref ref="A_10_6_10">Activity</xref> holds in general.

      Moreover, when <m>\theta</m> is an acute angle, it follows that <m>\cos(\theta) &gt; 0</m> so since
      <me>
        D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = |\nabla f(x_0,y_0)||\vu|
        \cos(\theta),

      and therefore <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) &gt; 0</m>, as shown in the middle image in <xref ref="F_10_6_gradient_sign">Figure</xref>. This means that <m>f</m> is increasing in any direction where
      <m>\theta</m> is acute. In a similar way, when <m>\theta</m> is an obtuse angle, then <m>\cos(\theta) \lt  0</m> so <m>D_{\vu}f(x_0,y_0) \lt  0</m>, as seen on the right in <xref ref="F_10_6_gradient_sign">Figure</xref>. This
      means that <m>f</m> is decreasing in any direction for which <m>\theta</m> is obtuse.

          <title>The Length of the Gradient</title>
          <p>
      Having established in <xref ref="A_10_6_3">Activity</xref> that the direction in which a function increases most rapidly at a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is the unit vector <m>\vu</m> in the direction of the gradient, (that is, <m>\vu = \frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|} \nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m>, provided that <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0) \ne \vzero</m>), it is also natural to ask, <q>in the direction of greatest increase for <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>, what is the <em>value</em> of the rate of increase?</q> In this situation, we are asking for the value of <m>D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0)</m> where <m>\vu = \frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|} \nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Using the now familiar way to compute the directional derivative, we see that
      <me>
        D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0) = \nabla f(x_0,y_0) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|} \nabla f(x_0,y_0) \right).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Next, we recall two important facts about the dot product: (i) <m>\vw\cdot (c \vv) = c (\vw \cdot \vv)</m> for any scalar <m>c</m>, and (ii) <m>\vw \cdot \vw = |\vw|^2</m>. Applying these properties to the most recent equation involving the directional derivative, we find that
      <me>
        D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0) = \frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|}  (\nabla f(x_0,y_0) \cdot \nabla f(x_0,y_0)) = \frac{1}{|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|} |\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|^2.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Finally, since <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0)</m> is a nonzero vector, its length <m>|\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|</m> is a nonzero scalar, and thus we can simplify the preceding equation to establish that
      <me>
        D_{\vu} f(x_0,y_0) = |\nabla f(x_0,y_0)|.
      </me>
    </p>

      We summarize our most recent work by stating two important facts about the gradient.

      The gradient finds many natural applications. For example, situations often arise <mdash/> for instance, constructing a road through the mountains or planning the flow of water across a landscape <mdash/> where we are
      interested in knowing the direction in which a function is increasing
      or decreasing most rapidly.
    </p>
          <p>
      For example, consider a two-dimensional version of how a heat-seeking
      missile might work.(This application is borrowed from United
        States Air Force Academy Department of Mathematical Sciences.)

      <statement><p>At a certain point on a heated metal plate, the 
      greatest rate of temperature increase, 4 degrees

      <solution><p>SOLUTION</p><p>Let <m>T</m> be the temperature function and <m>P</m> the point. 
       The value of the  greatest rate of increase is the magnitude of the gradient.
      Thus <m>\left| \nabla T (P) \right| = 4</m>.</p><p>The gradient points in the northeast direction, so 
      <m>\nabla T (P) = \left \langle 4 \cos (45^o) , 4 \sin (45^o) \right
      \rangle = \left \langle \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} \right \rangle</m>.</p><p>A unit vector in the north direction is <m>\mathbf{u} = \langle 0, 1 \rangle</m>, so the rate of change of increase of the temperature in that direction is

      We learn in single-variable calculus that the derivative is a useful tool for finding the local maxima
      and minima of functions, and that these ideas may often be employed in applied settings. In particular, if a function <m>f</m>,
      such as the one shown in <xref ref="F_10_7_preview_1">Figure</xref> is everywhere
      differentiable, we know that the tangent line is horizontal at any point
      where <m>f</m> has a local maximum or minimum. This, of course, means that the derivative <m>f'</m> is zero at any such point. Hence, one way that we seek extreme values of a given function is to first find where the derivative of the function is zero.
    </p>

          <p>
      In multivariable calculus, we are often similarly interested in finding the greatest and/or least value(s) that a function may achieve. Moreover, there are many applied settings in which a quantity of interest depends on several different variables. In the following preview activity, we begin to see how some key ideas in multivariable calculus can help us answer such questions by thinking about the geometry of the surface generated by a function of two variables.

          <title>Extrema and Critical Points</title>
          <p>
      One of the important applications of single-variable calculus is the use of derivatives to identify local extremes of functions (that is, local maxima and local minima). Using the tools we have developed so far, we can naturally extend
      the concept of local maxima and minima to several-variable functions.

      In single-variable calculus, we saw that the extrema of a continuous function <m>f</m> always occur at <em>critical points</em>, values of <m>x</m> where <m>f</m> fails to be differentiable or where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>. Said differently, critical points provide the locations where extrema of a function may appear. Our work in <xref ref="PA_10_7">Preview Activity</xref> suggests that something similar happens with two-variable functions.
    </p>
          <p>
      Suppose that a continuous function <m>f</m> has an extremum at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>. In this
      case, the trace <m>f(x,y_0)</m> has an extremum at <m>x_0</m>, which means
      that <m>x_0</m> is a critical value of <m>f(x,y_0)</m>. Therefore,
      either <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m> does not exist or <m>f_x(x_0,y_0) = 0</m>.
      Similarly, either <m>f_y(x_0,y_0)</m> does not exist or <m>f_y(x_0,y_0) =
      0</m>. This implies that the extrema of a two-variable function occur at points that satisfy the following definition.
    </p>
          <definition>
            <statement>
              <p>
          A <term>critical point</term><idx><h>critical point</h></idx>
          <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> of a function <m>f=f(x,y)</m> is a point in the domain of <m>f</m>
          at which <m>f_x(x_0,y_0) = 0</m> and
          <m>f_y(x_0,y_0) = 0</m>, or such that one of
          <m>f_x(x_0,y_0)</m> or <m>f_y(x_0,y_0)</m>
          fails to exist.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
      We can therefore find critical points of a function <m>f</m> by computing partial derivatives and identifying any values of <m>(x,y)</m> for which one of the partials doesn't exist or for which both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero. For the latter, note that we have to solve the system of equations

          <title>Classifying Critical Points: The Second Derivative Test</title>
          <p>
      While the extrema of a continuous function <m>f</m> always occur at critical points,
      it is important to note that not every critical point leads to
      an extremum. Recall, for instance, <m>f(x) = x^3</m> from single variable calculus. We know that <m>x_0=0</m> is a critical point since <m>f'(x_0) = 0</m>, but <m>x_0 = 0</m> is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum of <m>f</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      A similar situation may arise in a multivariable setting. Consider the function <m>f</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2</m> whose graph and contour
      plot are shown in <xref ref="F_10_7_saddle">Figure</xref>. Because <m>\nabla f =
      \langle 2x, -2y\rangle</m>, we see that the origin <m>(x_0,y_0)=(0,0)</m> is a
      critical point. However, this critical point is neither a local maximum or minimum; the origin is a local minimum on the trace defined by <m>y=0</m>, while the origin is a local maximum on the trace defined by <m>x=0</m>. We call such a critical point a <em>saddle point</em> due to the shape of the graph near the critical point.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_10_7_saddle">

        Recall that the <em>Second Derivative Test</em> for single-variable functions states that if <m>x_0</m> is a critical point of a function <m>f</m> so that <m>f'(x_0)=0</m> and if <m>f''(x_0)</m> exists, then

        You can verify that each function has a critical point at the origin <m>(0,0)</m>. You should check this.

              There is no single second derivative of a function of two variables, so we consider a quantity that combines the second order partial derivatives.

              Now consider the cases where <m>D \gt 0</m>. It is in these cases that a function has a local maximum or minimum at a point. What is necessary in these cases is to find a condition that will distinguish between a maximum and a minimum. In the cases where  <m>D \gt 0</m> at the origin, evaluate <m>f_{xx}(0,0)</m>. What value does <m>f_{xx}(0,0)</m> have when <m>f</m> has a local maximum value at the origin? When <m>f</m> has a local minimum value at the origin? Explain why. (Hint: This should look very similar to the Second Derivative Test for functions of a single variable.) What would happen if we considered the values of <m>f_{yy}(0,0)</m> instead?

      To properly understand the origin of the Second Derivative Test, we could introduce a <q>second-order directional derivative.</q> If this second-order directional derivative were negative in every direction, for instance, we could guarantee that the critical point is a local maximum. A complete justification of the Second Derivative Test requires key ideas from linear algebra that are beyond the scope of this course, so instead of presenting a detailed explanation, we will accept this test as stated. In <xref ref="A_10_7_5">Activity</xref>, we apply the test to more complicated examples.

      As we learned in single-variable calculus, finding extremal values of functions can be particularly useful in applied settings. For instance, we can often use calculus to determine the least expensive way to construct something or to find the most efficient route between two locations. The same possibility holds in settings with two or more variables.

        While the quantity of a product demanded by consumers is often a function of the price of the product, the demand for a product may also depend on the price of other products. For instance, the demand for blue jeans at Old Navy may be affected not only by the price of the jeans themselves, but also by the price of khakis.
      </p>
            <p>
        Suppose we have two goods whose respective prices are <m>p_1</m> and
        <m>p_2</m>. The demand for these goods, <m>q_1</m> and <m>q_2</m>, depend on the
        prices as

            <p>
        The seller would like to set the prices <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m> in order to maximize revenue. We will assume that the seller meets the full demand for each product. Thus, if we let <m>R</m> be the revenue obtained by selling <m>q_1</m> items of the first good at price <m>p_1</m> per item and <m>q_2</m> items of the second good at price <m>p_2</m> per item, we have

      The Second Derivative Test helps us classify critical points of a
      function, but it does not tell us if the function actually has an
      absolute maximum or minimum at each such point. For single-variable functions, the
      Extreme Value Theorem told us that a continuous function on a
      closed interval <m>[a, b]</m> always has both an absolute maximum and minimum on
      that interval, and that these absolute extremes must occur at either an endpoint or at a critical point. Thus, to find the absolute maximum and minimum, we determine the
      critical points in the interval and then evaluate the function at these
      critical points and at the endpoints of the interval. A similar approach works for functions of two variables.
    </p>
          <p>
      For functions of two variables, closed and bounded regions play the
      role that closed intervals did for functions of a single variable. A
      closed region is a region that contains its boundary (the unit disk <m>x^2+y^2 \leq 1</m> is closed, while its interior <m>x^2+y^2 \lt  1</m> is not, for example), while a bounded region is
      one that does not stretch to infinity in any direction. Just as for
      functions of a single variable, continuous functions of several
      variables that are defined on closed, bounded regions must have
      absolute maxima and minima in those regions.
    </p>
          <assemblage xml:id="Extreme-value-theorem">
            <title>The Extreme Value Theorem</title>
            <p>
      Let <m>f= f(x,y)</m>
      be a continuous function on a closed and bounded region <m>R</m>. Then
      <m>f</m> has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum in <m>R</m>.
    </p>
          </assemblage>
          <p>
      The absolute extremes must occur at either a critical point in the interior of
      <m>R</m> or at a boundary point of <m>R</m>. We
      therefore must test both possibilities, as we demonstrate in the following example.

          The domain <m>R=\{(x,y):x^2+y^2 \leq 1\}</m> is
          a closed and bounded region, as shown on the left of <xref ref="F_10_7_temperature">Figure</xref>, so the Extreme Value Theorem assures us
          that <m>T</m> has an absolute maximum and minimum on the plate. The
          graph of <m>T</m> over its domain <m>R</m> is shown in <xref ref="F_10_7_temperature">Figure</xref>. We will find the hottest and coldest
          points on the plate.

          If the absolute maximum or minimum occurs inside the disk, it will be at a critical point so we begin by looking for critical points inside the disk. To do this, notice that critical points are given by the conditions <m>T_x= 4x=0</m> and <m>T_y=2y - 1=0</m>. This means that there is one critical point of the function at the point <m>(x_0,y_0) =(0,1/2)</m>, which lies inside the disk.
        </p>
              <p>
          We now find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary of the
          disk, which is the circle of radius 1. As we have seen, the points on the unit circle can be parametrized as
          <me>
            x(t) = \cos(t), \ y(t) = \sin(t),
          </me>
          where <m>0\leq t \leq 2\pi</m>. The temperature at a point on the circle is then described by
          <me>
            T(x(t), y(t)) = 2\cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) - \sin(t).
          </me>
        </p>
              <p>
          To find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary, we look for the critical points of this single-variable function on the interval <m>0\leq t\leq 2\pi</m>.
          We have
          <md><mrow>

             \amp  = -2\cos(t)\sin(t) - \cos(t) = \cos(t) (-2\sin(t) - 1)

          This shows that we have critical points when <m>\cos(t) = 0</m> or <m>\sin(t) = -1/2</m>. This occurs when <m>t=\pi/2</m>, <m>3\pi/2</m>, <m>7\pi/6</m>, and <m>11\pi/6</m>. Since we have <m>x(t) = \cos(t)</m> and <m>y(t) = \sin(t)</m>, the corresponding

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      To test the critical point, we use the second derivative test by
      evaluating <m>D = k_{xx} k_{yy} - (k_{xy})^2</m>.  Here,
      <me>D = (- \cos( x) e^{-y^2})(\cos( x) (-2 e^{y^2} + 4y^2 e^{y^2})) - (10 y \sin( x) e^{y^2})^2,</me>
      so that at the origin, <m>D = 50</m>.



      Thus <m>D&gt; 0</m>, and <m>f_{xx} \lt  0</m>,  so <m>k(0,0)</m> is a maximum.

      <answer><p><m>2\sqrt{3\cdot 1}+2\sqrt{4\cdot 2}</m></p></answer>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      The function <m>f</m> is continuous in the region <m>R</m>, but <m>R</m> is not
      closed and bounded so a special analysis is required.




      Notice that
      <m>f(x,y)</m> tends to <m>\infty</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> tends farther and farther
      from the origin or tends toward any point on the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> axis.
      This suggests that a minimum for <m>f</m>, if it exists, can not be too
      far from the origin or too close to the axes.  For example, if
      <m>x &gt; 10</m> then <m>f(x,y) &gt; 3 x &gt; 30</m>,
      and if <m>y &gt; 10</m>
      then <m>f(x,y) &gt; 4 y &gt; 40</m>.
      If <m>0\lt x\lt 0.1</m> then <m>f(x,y) &gt; 1/x &gt; 10</m>, and if <m>0\lt y\lt 0.1</m> then
      <m>f(x,y) &gt; 2/y &gt; 20</m>.




      Since <m>f(1,1)=10</m>, a global minimum for <m>f</m> if it exists must be in
      the smaller region
      <m>R^\prime: 0.1 \le x \le 10</m>, <m>0.1 \le y \le 10</m>.  The region
      <m>R^\prime</m> is closed and bounded and
      so  have a  minimum value at some point in  <m>R^\prime</m>, and
      since that value is at most
      10, it is also a global minimum for all of <m>R</m>.




      Since the region <m>R</m> has no boundary, the minimum value must
      occur at a critical point of <m>f</m>.
      At a critical point we have
      <me>f_x = -{1\over x^2} + 3 = 0 = f_y = -{2\over y^2} + 4 = 0.</me>
      The only critical point is <m>(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}, \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}})</m>, at which
      <m>f</m> achieves the minimum value
      <me>f(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}},\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}) = 2\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{8}</me></solution>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      At the critical point <m>x=7</m>, <m>y=0</m>,
      <me>f_x = 2x + A = 14 + A = 0,</me>
      and
      <me>f_y = 2y = 0,</me>
      so that <m>A = -14</m>.




      Then, for this to be a minimum, we must have <m>D &gt; 0</m> and <m>f_{xx} &gt; 0</m>.
      Here, <m>f_{xx} = 2</m>, <m>f_{yy} = 2</m>, and <m>f_{xy} = 0</m>, so
      <me>D = 4 - 0 = 4 &gt; 0</me>
      and <m>f_{xx} &gt; 0</m>.  Thus this is a minimum, as advertised.




      For it to occur with a <m>z</m>-coordinate of 5, we must have
      <me>f(7,0) = -49 + B = 5,</me>
      so that <m>B = 54</m>.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      At each point we have <m>f_x = f_y = 0</m>, so each of the three points
      is a critical point.  Then we have <m>D = f_{xx} f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2</m>,
      so we know that



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      At <m>(5,1)</m>, <m>D \lt  0</m>, so
      (5,1) is a saddle point.




      <alert>(b)</alert>
      At <m>(7,3)</m>, <m>D \lt  0</m>, so
      (7,3) is a saddle point.




      <alert>(c)</alert>
      At <m>(9,4)</m>, <m>D \lt  0</m>, so
      (9,4) is a saddle point.

      The surface area <m>S</m> is given by
      <me>S = 2xy+2xz+2yz.</me>
      Substituting <m>z = 22/(xy)</m> gives
      <me>S = 2xy +\frac{44}{y} + \frac{44}{x}.</me>
      At a critical point,
      <me>\frac{\partial S}{\partial x} = 2y - \frac{44}{x^2} = 0,</me>
      and
      <me>\frac{\partial S}{\partial y} = 2x - \frac{44}{y^2} = 0.</me>

      The symmetry of the equations (or by dividing the equations) tells us that
      <m>x=y</m> and so that
      <me>2x - \frac{44}{x^2} = 0,</me>
      so that
      <me>x^3 = 22, \quad\mbox{and so}\quad x = 22^{1/3}\mbox{ cm}.</me>
      Thus the only critical point is <m>x = y = (22)^{1/3}</m> cm, and
      <m>z = 22/\left ( (22)^{1/3} \cdot (22)^{1/3} \right ) =
      (22)^{1/3}</m> cm.
      At the critical point
      <me>S_{xx} S_{yy}-(S_{xy})^2= \frac{88}{x^3}\cdot\frac{88}{y^3}-2^2=
      \frac{(88)^2}{x^{3}y^{3}}-4.</me>
      Since <m>D&gt;0</m> and <m>S_{xx}&gt;0</m> at this critical point, the critical point
      <m>x = y = z = (22)^{1/3}</m> is a local minimum.
      Since <m>S\rightarrow\infty</m> as
      <m>x,y\rightarrow\infty</m>, the local minimum is a global minimum.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      Let the sides of the base be <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> cm.  Let the height
      be <m>z</m> cm. Then the volume is given by <m>xyz = 26</m> and the
      surface area, <m>S</m>, is given by
      <me>S = xy + 2xz + 2yz.</me>
      Substituting <m>z = 26/(xy)</m> gives
      <me>S = xy + \frac{52}{y} + \frac{52}{x}.</me>
      At a critical point
      <me>\frac{\partial S}{\partial x} = y - \frac{52}{x^2} = 0,</me>
      and
      <me>\frac{\partial S}{\partial y} = x - \frac{52}{y^2} = 0.</me>

      The symmetry of the equations tells us that <m>x=y</m>, so
      <me>x - \frac{52}{x^2} = 0, \quad\mbox{and}\quad x^3 = 52,</me>
      so that
      <m>x = (52)^{1/3}</m> cm.

      Thus the only critical point is <m>x=y=(52)^{1/3}</m> cm and 
      <m>z = 26/((52)^{1/3}\cdot (52)^{1/3}) = (13/2)^{1/3}</m> cm.




      At the critical point
      <me>D = S_{xx}S_{yy}-(S_{xy})^2 =\frac{104}{x^3} \cdot
      \frac{104}{y^3}-1^2= \frac{104^2}{x^3y^3}-1.</me>
      Since <m>D&gt;0</m> and <m>S_{xx}&gt;0</m> at this critical point, the critical
      point <m>x = y = (52)^{1/3}</m>, <m>z = (13/2)^{1/3}</m> is a local minimum. Since
      <m>S\rightarrow\infty</m> as
      <m>x,y\rightarrow\infty</m>, the local minimum is a global minimum.

      <answer><p><m>\sqrt{29}</m></p></answer>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      We minimize the square of the distance from the point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the
      origin:
      <me>S=x^2+y^2+z^2.</me>
      Since <m>z^2 = 41 - x y - 6 x</m>, we have
      <me>S = x^2 + y^2 + 41 - x y - 6 x.</me>
      At a critical point
      <me>\frac{\partial S}{\partial x} = 2 x - y - 6 = 0,</me>
      and
      <me>\frac{\partial S}{\partial y} = 2 y - x = 0,</me>
      so <m>x = 2 y</m>, and
      <me>2(2 y) - y - 6 = 0</me>
      giving <m>y=2</m>, so <m>x=4</m> and
      <m>z^2 = 41 - (4)(2) - 6 (4)</m>, so <m>z=\pm 3</m>.
      We have
      <me>D= S_{xx}S_{yy}-(S_{xy})^2 =2\cdot2 - (-1)^2 = 4 - 1 &gt; 0,</me>
      so, since <m>D&gt;0</m> and <m>S_{xx}&gt;0</m>, the critical points are local
      minima.  Since <m>S\rightarrow\infty</m> as <m>x,y\rightarrow\pm\infty</m>, the
      local minima are global minima.




      If <m>x=4</m>, <m>y=2</m>, <m>z=\pm 3</m>, we have
      <m>S = 4^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 29</m>,
      so the shortest distance to the origin is <m>\sqrt{29}</m>.

      <answer><p><m>12.5992, 6.2996, 6.29962</m></p></answer>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      The cost of four sides <m>=(2hl+2wh)(1)</m> cents.  The cost of top and
      bottom <m>=(2wl)(2)</m> cents.  Thus the total cost <m>C</m> (in cents) of
      the box is
      <me>C = 2(hl+wh) + 4 wl.</me>
      But the volume <m>= wlh = 500</m>, so <m>l = 500/(wh)</m>, thus
      <me>C = \frac{1000}{w} + 2 wh + \frac{2000}{h}.</me>
      To minimize <m>C</m>, we find the critical points of <m>C</m> by solving
      <me>C_h = 2 w - \frac{2000}{h^2} = 0,</me>
      and
      <me>C_w = 2 h - \frac{1000}{w^2} = 0.</me>
      We get
      <me>2 w h^2 = 2000, \quad\mbox{and}\quad 2 h w^2 = 1000,</me>
      Since <m>w</m>, <m>h \ne 0</m>, we can divide the first equation by the second,
      giving
      <me>\frac{2 w h^2}{2 h w^2} = \frac{2000}{1000},</me>
      so 
      <me>\frac{h}{w} = 2,</me>
      thus 
      <me>h = 2 w.</me>
      Substituting this into <m>C_w = 0</m>, we obtain <m>w^3 = \frac{500}{3}</m>, so
      <m>w = 6.2996</m> and <m>h = 12.5992</m> cm.  Then 
      <m>l = 500/(wh) = 6.29962</m> cm.



      Next we can check that these dimensions minimize the cost C.  We find that
      <me>D=C_{hh}C_{ww}-C^2_{hw} = 
          (\frac{4000}{h^3})(\frac{2000}{w^3}) - 2^2,</me>
      So that at the critical point, <m>D &gt; 0</m> and <m>C_{hh} &gt; 0</m>, and
      thus <m>C</m> has a local minimum at <m>h=12.5992</m> and <m>w=6.2996</m>.
      Since <m>C</m> increases without
      bound as <m>w,h\to 0</m> or <m>\infty</m>, this local minimum must be a global
      minimum.




      Therefore, the dimensions of the box that minimize the cost are
      <m>w=6.2996</m> cm, <m>l=6.29962</m> cm and <m>h=12.5992</m> cm.

            A manufacturer wants to procure rectangular boxes to ship its product. The boxes must contain 20 cubic feet of space. To be durable enough to ensure the safety of the product, the material for the sides of the boxes will cost $0.10 per square foot, while the material for the top and bottom will cost $0.25 per square foot. In this activity we will help the manufacturer determine the box of minimal cost.

            A rectangular box with length <m>x</m>, width <m>y</m>, and height <m>z</m> is being built. The box is positioned so that one corner is stationed at the origin and the box lies in the first octant where <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> are all positive. There is an added constraint on how the box is constructed: it must fit underneath the plane with equation <m>x + 2y + 3z = 6</m>. In fact, we will assume that the corner of the box <q>opposite</q> the origin must actually lie on this plane. The basic problem is to find the maximum volume of the box.

            According to <em>The Song of Insects</em> by G.W. Pierce (Harvard College Press, 1948) the sound of striped ground crickets chirping, in number of chirps per second, is related to the temperature. So the number of chirps per second could be a predictor of temperature. The data Pierce collected is shown in <xref ref="T-10-7-chirps">Table</xref>., where <m>x</m> is the (average) number of chirps per second and <m>y</m> is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. 
          </p>

          <p>
            A scatterplot of the data would show that, while the relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is not exactly linear, it looks to have a linear pattern. It could be that the relationship is really linear but experimental error causes the data to be slightly inaccurate. Or perhaps the data is not linear, but only approximately linear.

            If we want to use the data to make predications, then we need to fit a curve of some kind to the data. Since the cricket data appears roughly linear, we will fit a linear function <m>f</m> of the form <m>f(x) = mx+b</m> to the data. We will do this in such a way that we minimize the sums of the squares of the distances between the <m>y</m> values of the data and the corresponding <m>y</m> values of the line defined by <m>f</m>. This type of fit is called a <em>least squares</em> approximation. If the data is represented by the points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>, <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>(x_n,y_n)</m>, then the square of the distance between <m>y_i</m> and <m>f(x_i)</m> is <m>(f(x_i)-y_i)^2 = (mx_i+b-y_i)^2</m>.

      We previously considered how to find the extreme values of functions on both unrestricted domains and on closed, bounded domains. Other types of optimization problems involve maximizing or minimizing a quantity subject to an external constraint. In these cases the extreme values frequently won't occur at the points where the gradient is zero, but rather at other points that satisfy an important geometric condition. These problems are often called <em>constrained optimization</em> problems and can be solved with the method of Lagrange Multipliers, which we study in this section.

        According to U.S.<nbsp/>postal regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches, where by <q>girth</q> we mean the perimeter of the smallest end. Our goal is to find the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by mail. (We solved this applied optimization problem in single variable <em>Active Calculus</em>, so it may look familiar. We take a different approach in this section, and this approach allows us to view most applied optimization problems from single variable calculus as constrained optimization problems, as well as provide us tools to solve a greater variety of optimization problems.) If we let <m>x</m> be the length of the side of one square end of the package and <m>y</m> the length of the package, then we want to maximize the volume <m>f(x,y) = x^2y</m> of the box subject to the constraint that the girth (<m>4x</m>) plus the length (<m>y</m>) is as large as possible, or <m>4x+y = 108</m>. The equation <m>4x + y = 108</m> is thus an external constraint on the variables.

        <subsection>
          <title>Constrained Optimization and Lagrange Multipliers</title>
          <p>
      In <xref ref="PA_10_8">Preview Activity</xref>, we considered an optimization problem where there is an external constraint on the variables, namely that the girth plus the length of the package cannot exceed 108 inches. We saw that we can create a function <m>g</m> from the constraint, specifically <m>g(x,y) = 4x+y</m>. The constraint equation is then just a contour of <m>g</m>, <m>g(x, y) = c</m>, where <m>c</m> is a constant (in our case 108). <xref ref="F_10_8_Lagrange1">Figure</xref> illustrates that the volume function <m>f</m> is maximized, subject to the constraint <m>g(x, y) = c</m>, when the graph of <m>g(x, y) = c</m> is tangent to a contour of <m>f</m>. Moreover, the value of <m>f</m> on this contour is the sought maximum value.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_10_8_Lagrange1">
            <caption>Contours of <m>f</m> and the constraint contour.</caption>
            <image width="50%" source="images/fig_10_8_postal_solution"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      To find this point where the graph of the constraint is tangent to a contour of <m>f</m>, recall that <m>\nabla f</m> is perpendicular to the contours of <m>f</m> and <m>\nabla g</m> is perpendicular to the contour of <m>g</m>. At such a point, the vectors <m>\nabla g</m> and <m>\nabla f</m> are parallel, and thus we need to determine the points where this occurs. Recall that two vectors are parallel if one is a nonzero scalar multiple of the other, so we therefore look for values of a parameter <m>\lambda</m> that make
      <men xml:id="eq_10_8_Lagrange_ex1">
        \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g.
      </men>
    </p>
          <p>
      The constant <m>\lambda</m> is called a <em>Lagrange multiplier</em><idx><h>Lagrange multiplier</h></idx>.
    </p>
          <p>
      To find the values of <m>\lambda</m> that satisfy <xref ref="eq_10_8_Lagrange_ex1"/> for the volume function in <xref ref="PA_10_8">Preview Activity</xref>, we calculate both <m>\nabla f</m> and <m>\nabla g</m>. Observe that
      <me>
        \nabla f = 2xy \vi + x^2 \vj \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \nabla g = 4\vi + \vj,
      </me>
      and thus we need a value of <m>\lambda</m> so that
      <me>
        2xy \vi + x^2 \vj = \lambda(4\vi + \vj).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Equating components in the most recent equation and incorporating the original constraint, we have three equations
      <mdn><mrow xml:id="eq_10_8_lag_ex1">
         2xy \amp = \lambda (4) 
      </mrow><mrow xml:id="eq_10_8_lag_ex2">
         x^2 \amp = \lambda (1) 
      </mrow><mrow xml:id="eq_10_8_lag_ex3">
         4x+y \amp = 108 
      </mrow></mdn>
      in the three unknowns <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>\lambda</m>. First, note that if <m>\lambda = 0</m>, then equation <xref ref="eq_10_8_lag_ex2"/> shows that <m>x=0</m>. From this, Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_10_8_lag_ex3"/> tells us that <m>y = 108</m>. So the point <m>(0,108)</m> is a point we need to consider. Next, provided that <m>\lambda \neq 0</m> (from which it follows that <m>x \neq 0</m> by Equation <xref ref="eq_10_8_lag_ex2"/>), we may divide both sides of Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_10_8_lag_ex1"/> by the corresponding sides of <xref ref="eq_10_8_lag_ex2"/> to eliminate <m>\lambda</m>, and thus find that
      <md><mrow>\frac{2y}{x} \amp = 4, \ \mbox{so}</mrow><mrow>y \amp = 2x.</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      Substituting into Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_10_8_lag_ex3"/> gives us
      <me>
        4x+2x = 108
      </me>
      or
      <me>
        x = 18.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Thus we have <m>y = 2x = 36</m> and <m>\lambda = x^2 = 324</m> as another point to consider. So the points at which the gradients of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are parallel, and thus at which <m>f</m> may have a maximum or minimum subject to the constraint, are <m>(0,108)</m> and <m>(18,36)</m>. By evaluating the function <m>f</m> at these points, we see that we maximize the volume when the length of the square end of the box is 18 inches and the length is 36 inches, for a maximum volume of <m>f(18,36) = 11664</m> cubic inches. Since <m>f(0,108) = 0</m>, we obtain a minimum value at this point.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      Our objective function is <m>f(x,y)= 3 x - 4 y</m> and our equation of
      constraint is <m>g(x,y) = x^2 + 3 y^2 = 129</m>.  To optimize <m>f(x,y)</m>
      with Lagrange multipliers we solve the following system of equations
      <me>f_{x}(x,y) = \lambda g_{x}(x,y),\qquad\mbox{so } 3 = 2\lambda x,</me><me>f_{y}(x,y) = \lambda g_{y}(x,y),\qquad\mbox{so } -4 = 6\lambda y,</me>
      and
      <me>g(x,y) = 129,\qquad\mbox{so } x^2 + 3 y^2 = 129.</me>
      Solving for <m>\lambda</m> gives us
      <me>\lambda = \frac{3}{2 x} = \frac{-2}{3 y},</me>
      which we can use to find <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>:
      <me>x = -\frac{9}{4}\,y.</me>
      Using this relation in our equation of constraint, we can solve for
      <m>y</m>:
      <me>x^2 + 3 y^2 = 129,</me>
      so
      <me>(-\frac{9}{4}\, y)^2 + 3 y^2 = 129,</me>
      and thus
      <me>((\frac{9}{4})^2 + 3)\, y^2 = 129.</me>
      So, solving for <m>y</m>, we have <m>y = \pm 4</m>, and <m>x = \mp 9</m>.
      Thus, the critical points are <m>(-9,4)</m> and <m>(9,-4)</m>.  Since
      the constraint is closed and bounded, maximum and minimum values of <m>f</m>
      subject to the constraint exist.  Evaluating <m>f</m> at the critical
      points, we find that the maximum value is
      <m>f(9,-4) = 3(9) + 4(4) = 43</m> and the minimum
      value is <m>f(-9,4) = -3(9) - 4(4) = -43</m>.

       SOLUTION 



      We first find the critical points of <m>f</m>:
      <me>f_x = 2xy = 0, \quad
         f_y = x^2 + 6 y - 1 = 0.</me>
      From the first equation, we get either <m>x=0</m> or <m>y=0</m>.
      If <m>x=0</m>, from the second equation we get <m>6 y - 1 = 0</m>,
      so <m>y=1/6</m>.  If instead <m>y=0</m>,
      then from the second equation <m>x=\pm 1</m>.  We conclude that the critical
      points are <m>(0,1/6)</m>, <m>(1,0)</m>, and <m>(-1,0)</m>. All three critical
      points satisfy the constraint <m>x^2+y^2\le 38.3333333333333</m>.




      The Lagrange conditions, <m>\nabla f= \lambda\nabla g</m>, are:
      <me>2xy=\lambda 2x,\qquad x^2 + 6 y - 1 =\lambda 2y.</me>
      From the first equation, when <m>x\neq 0</m>, we divide by <m>2x</m>
      to get <m>\lambda=y</m>.  Substituting into the second equation,
      we get
      <me>x^2 + 6 y - 1 = 2y^2.</me>
      Then using <m>x^2 = 38.3333333333333 - y^2</m> from the constraint, we have
      <me>38.3333333333333 - y^2 + 6 y - 1 = 2 y^2,</me>
      so <m>3 y^2 - 6 y - 37.3333333333333 = 0</m>.  Factoring, we get
      <m>(3y + 8 )( y - 4.66666666666667 ) = 0</m>, so
      <m>y = -2.66666666666667</m> or <m>y = 4.66666666666667</m>.
      From the constraint, we get <m>x=\pm \sqrt{31.2222222222222}</m> when <m>y=-2.66666666666667</m> and
      <m>x=\pm \sqrt{16.5555555555555}</m> for <m>y=4.66666666666667</m>.



      If instead <m>x=0</m>, so that we cannot
      divide by <m>x</m> in the first Lagrange equation, then from the constraint,
      <m>y=\pm \sqrt{38.3333333333333}</m>.



      Summarizing, the following points are either critical points or satisfy
      the Lagrange conditions:
      <me>(\pm 1,0),(0,1/6),(\pm \sqrt{31.2222222222222}, -2.66666666666667),(\pm \sqrt{16.5555555555555}, 4.66666666666667),
      (0, -\sqrt{38.3333333333333}), \mbox{ and } (0, \sqrt{38.3333333333333}).</me>
      These are the candidates for global maximum or minimum points.
      The corresponding values for <m>f(x,y)=x^2 y + 3 y^2 - y</m> are:
      <me>0, -0.083, -59.259, 137.926, 121.191,
         \mbox{ and } 108.809.</me>
      The largest value is <m>137.926</m> at the point
      <m>(\pm \sqrt{16.5555555555555},4.66666666666667)</m>,
      and the smallest value is <m>-59.2593</m> at
      <m>(\pm \sqrt{31.2222222222222},-2.66666666666667)</m>,

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      Let <m>(x,y,z)</m> be a point on the paraboloid.
      The square of the distance from
      <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the point <m>(1,1,11)</m> is given by
      <me>f(x,y,z) = (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-11)^2,</me>
      and so we wish to minimize <m>f(x,y,z)</m> subject to the constraint
      <me>g(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2-z = 0.</me>
      We look for solutions to the equations
      <m>\nabla f = \lambda\nabla g</m> and <m>g=0</m>:
      <me>2(x-1) = 2\lambda x,</me><me>2(y-1) = 2\lambda y,</me><me>2(z-11) = -\lambda,</me>
      and
      <me>x^2+y^2-z = 0.</me>
      If <m>\lambda=0</m>, the first three equations would imply that
      <m>(x,y,z)=(1,1,11)</m>, which does not satisfy the fourth
      equation and so <m>\lambda\ne 0</m>. If collect terms in <m>x</m> and
      <m>y</m> in the first and second equations, respectively, we get
      <me>(1 - \lambda) x = 1,</me>
      and
      <me>(1 - \lambda) y = 1.</me>
      Note that we cannot have <m>\lambda = 1</m>, <m>x = 0</m> or <m>y = 0</m>,
      and so can divide these two equation to solve for <m>y</m>, getting
      <me>y =  x</me>.



      If we divide the first and third equations we got from the
      Lagrange multipliers method, we have
      <me>\frac{x - 1}{z - 11} = -2x,</me>
      so that
      <me>z = 11 - \frac12(1 - \frac{1}{x}).</me>



      We can then plug all of these into the last equation, the constraint.
      This gives
      <me>x^2 +  x^2 - 11 + \frac12(1 - \frac{1}{x}) = 0.</me>
      Multiplying by <m>x</m> and collecting terms, we have
      <me>4 x^3 - 21 x - 1 = 0.</me>
      Let <m>h(x) = 4 x^3 - 21 x - 1</m>.  Clearly
      <m>h(-3) \lt  0</m>, <m>h(-\frac12) &gt; 0</m>, <m>h(0) \lt  0</m> and <m>h(3) &gt; 0</m>.
      Thus there must be roots lying between <m>x = -3</m> and <m>x = -0.5</m>,
      between <m>x = -0.5</m> and <m>x = 0</m>, and between <m>x = 0</m> and
      <m>x = 3</m>.  We can locate these numerically using a calculator or
      computer program, to find
      <me>x = -2.267096556, \quad x = -0.04763964188, \quad\mbox{and}\quad
         x = 2.314736198.</me>
      Then, using the equations for <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> in terms of <m>x</m>, we
      have the corresponding values of <m>y</m> and <m>z</m>, and therefore
      have three solutions to the Lagrange multiplier equations:
      <me>x_1 = -2.267096556, y_1 = -2.267096556, z_1 = 10.2794535884541,</me><me>x_2 = -0.04763964188, y_2 = -0.04763964188, z_2 = 0.0045390709569093,</me>
      and
      <me>x_3 = 2.314736198, y_3 = 2.314736198, z_3 = 10.716007332663.</me>



      The distances (squared) from the paraboloid are
      <me>d_1 = d(x_1,y_1,z_1) = 21.8670269436458,</me><me>d_2 = d(x_2,y_2,z_2) = 123.09525868059,</me>
      and
      <me>d_3 = d(x_3,y_3,z_3) = 3.53771437576418,</me>
      so that the minimum distance is <m>\sqrt{d_3} = 1.88088</m>.




      Note that the geometric interpretation of this is that it is the
      length of a perpendicular line segment drawn from the paraboloid
      to the point.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      The critical points of <m>h(x,y)</m> occur where
      <me>h_x(x,y) = 2 x - 2 \lambda = 0</me>
      and
      <me>h_y(x,y) = 2 y - 8 \lambda = 0.</me>
      The only critical point is <m>(x,y) = ( \lambda, 4 \lambda)</m>
      and it gives a minimum value for <m>h(x,y)</m>.  That minimum value is
      <me>m(\lambda) = h( \lambda, 4 \lambda) =
            \lambda^2 + 16 \lambda^2 -
      	\lambda( 2 \lambda + 32 \lambda - 20 )</me>
      or
      <me>m(\lambda) = -17 \lambda^2 + 20 \lambda.</me><alert>(b)</alert>
      The maximum value of <m>m(\lambda)= -17 \lambda^2 + 20\lambda</m>
      occurs at a critical point, where
      <m>m'(\lambda) = -34 \lambda + 20 = 0</m>.
      At this point, <m>\lambda = 0.588235</m> and
      <m>m(0.588235)= 5.88235</m>.




      <alert>(c)</alert>
      We want to minimize <m>f(x,y)=x^2+y^2</m>
      subject to the constraint <m>g(x,y)=20</m>, where
      <m>g(x,y) = 2 x + 8 y</m>.  The method of Lagrange multipliers
      has us solve
      <me>2x = 2\lambda,</me><me>2y = 8\lambda,</me>
      and
      <me>2 x + 8 y = 20.</me>
      We can see that this gives the same solutions for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
      as we obtained in part (a), and then, plugging in to the third equation,
      we have
      <me>2 \lambda + 32 \lambda = 20.</me>
      Thus we get the same <m>\lambda</m> as before:
      <m>\lambda = 0.588235</m>, so that the minimum value
      of <m>f</m> is <m>f(\lambda, 4\lambda)</m>, where
      <m>\lambda = 0.588235</m>, or <m>f_{\mbox{min}} = 5.88235</m>.




      Note that the two question have the same answer.  This makes sense,
      because in the first problem the largest minimum value will clearly
      occur when <m>2 x + 8 y = 20</m>, which is the constraint in the third
      equation.

       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      Let <m>f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=\sum_{i=1}^3{x_i}^2 = {x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 + {x_3}^2</m>
      and <m>g(x_1,x_2,x_3)=\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i = 4</m>.
      Then <m>\nabla f = \lambda\nabla g</m> gives
      <me>2x_1 = \lambda = 2x_2 = 2x_3.</me>
      so
      <me>x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \frac{\lambda}2.</me>
      Then <m>x_1+x_2+x_3 = 4</m> gives
      <me>3\frac{\lambda}{2} = 4\quad\hbox{ so } \quad \lambda = \frac{8}{3}.</me>
      Thus <m>x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \frac{4}{3}</m>.



      These values of <m>x_1, x_2,x_3</m> give the minimum (rather than maximum)
      because the value of  without bound as

      <alert>(b)</alert>
      A similar argument shows that <m>\sum_{i=1}^nx_i</m> has its minimum value

      <me>x_1=x_2=\cdots= x_n=\frac{4}n.</me>
      Then the minimum value is

            In this exercise we consider how to apply the Method of Lagrange Multipliers to optimize functions of three variable subject to two constraints. Suppose we want to optimize <m>f = f(x,y,z)</m> subject to the constraints <m>g(x,y,z) = c</m> and <m>h(x,y,z) = k</m>. Also suppose that the two level surfaces <m>g(x,y,z) = c</m> and <m>h(x,y,z) = k</m> intersect at a curve <m>C</m>. The optimum point <m>P = (x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> will then lie on <m>C</m>.  
            <ol label="a."><li>
                <p>
                  Assume that <m>C</m> can be represented parametrically by a vector-valued function <m>\vr = \vr(t)</m>. Let <m>\overrightarrow{OP} = \vr(t_0)</m>. Use the Chain Rule applied to <m>f(\vr(t))</m>, <m>g(\vr(t))</m>, and <m>h(\vr(t))</m>, to explain why

                  Explain how this shows that <m>\nabla f(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>, <m>\nabla g(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>, and <m>\nabla h(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m> are all orthogonal to <m>C</m> at <m>P</m>.

              <p>
            There is a useful interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier <m>\lambda</m>. Assume that we want to optimize a function <m>f</m> with constraint <m>g(x,y)=c</m>. Recall that an optimal solution occurs at a point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> where <m>\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g</m>. As the constraint changes, so does the point at which the optimal solution occurs. So we can think of the optimal point as a function of the parameter <m>c</m>, that is <m>x_0 = x_0(c)</m> and <m>y_0=y_0(c)</m>. The optimal value of <m>f</m> subject to the constraint can then be considered as a function of <m>c</m> defined by <m>f(x_0(c), y_0(c))</m>. The Chain Rule shows that
            <me>
              \frac{df}{dc} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_0} \frac{dx_0}{dc} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y_0} \frac{dy_0}{dc}.

                  Use the fact that <m>\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> to explain why
                  <me>
                    \frac{df}{dc} = \lambda \frac{dg}{dc}.

                    \frac{df}{dc} = \lambda.

                  Conclude that <m>\lambda</m> tells us the rate of change of the function <m>f</m> as the parameter <m>c</m> increases (or by approximately how much the optimal value of the function <m>f</m> will change if we increase the value of <m>c</m> by 1 unit).

        <introduction>
          <p>
      In single-variable calculus, recall that we approximated the area under the graph of a positive function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> by adding areas of rectangles whose heights are determined by the curve. The general process involved subdividing the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into smaller subintervals, constructing rectangles on each of these smaller intervals to approximate the region under the curve on that subinterval, then summing the areas of these rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. We will extend this process in this section to its three-dimensional analogs, double Riemann sums and double integrals over rectangles.
    </p>
          <exploration xml:id="PA_11_1">
            <p>
        In this activity we introduce the concept of a double Riemann sum.

        <p>
          Review the concept of the Riemann sum from single-variable calculus. Then, explain how we define the definite integral <m>\int_a^b f(x) \ dx</m> of a continuous function of a single variable <m>x</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Include a sketch of a continuous function on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> with appropriate labeling in order to illustrate your definition.
        </p>
      </li>
              <li>
        <p>
          In our upcoming study of integral calculus for multivariable functions, we will first extend the idea of the single-variable definite integral to functions of two variables over rectangular domains. To do so, we will need to understand how to partition a rectangle into subrectangles. Let <m>R</m> be rectangular domain <m>R = \{(x,y) : 0 \leq x \leq 6, 2 \leq y \leq 4\}</m> (we can also represent this domain with the notation <m>[0,6] \times [2,4]</m>), as pictured in <xref ref="F_11_1_Domain">Figure</xref>.

          <figure xml:id="F_11_1_Domain"><caption>Rectangular domain <m>R</m> with subrectangles.</caption><image width="50%" source="images/fig_11_1_rect_domain"/></figure>

          <p>

          </p>

          To form a partition of the full rectangular region, <m>R</m>, we will partition both intervals <m>[0,6]</m> and <m>[2,4]</m>; in particular, we choose to partition the interval <m>[0,6]</m> into three uniformly sized subintervals and the interval <m>[2,4]</m> into two evenly sized subintervals as shown in <xref ref="F_11_1_Domain">Figure</xref>. In the following questions, we discuss how to identify the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting subrectangles.

          <title>Double Riemann Sums over Rectangles</title>
          <p>
      For the definite integral in single-variable calculus, we considered a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval <m>[a,b]</m>. In multivariable calculus, we will eventually develop the idea of a definite integral over a closed, bounded region (such as the interior of a circle). We begin with a simpler situation by thinking only about rectangular domains, and will address more complicated domains in <xref ref="S-11-3-Double-Integrals-General">Section</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Let <m>f = f(x,y)</m> be a continuous function defined on a rectangular domain <m>R = \{(x,y) : a \leq x \leq b, c \leq y \leq d\}</m>. As we saw in <xref ref="PA_11_1">Preview Activity</xref>, the domain is a rectangle <m>R</m> and we want to partition <m>R</m> into subrectangles. We do this by partitioning each of the intervals <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>[c,d]</m> into subintervals and using those subintervals to create a partition of <m>R</m> into subrectangles. In the first activity, we address the quantities and notations we will use in order to define double Riemann sums and double integrals.

        Let <m>f(x,y) = 100 - x^2-y^2</m> be defined on the rectangular domain <m>R = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m>. Partition the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into four uniformly sized subintervals and the interval <m>[c,d]</m> into three evenly sized subintervals as shown in <xref ref="F_11_1_Domain2">Figure</xref>. As we did in <xref ref="PA_11_1">Preview Activity</xref>, we will need a method for identifying the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting subrectangles.

          <title>Interpretation of Double Riemann Sums and Double integrals.</title>
          <p>
      At the moment, there are two ways we can interpret the value of the double integral.
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>f(x,y)</m> assumes both positive and negatives
              values on the rectangle <m>R</m>, as shown on the left of <xref ref="F_11_1_signed">Figure</xref>.  When constructing a Riemann sum, for each <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>, the product <m>f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*) \cdot \Delta A</m>
            can be interpreted as a <q>signed</q> volume of a box with base area <m>\Delta A</m> and <q>signed</q> height <m>f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*)</m>. Since <m>f</m> can have negative values, this <q>height</q> could be negative. The sum
            <me>
              \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*) \cdot \Delta A
            </me>
            can then be interpreted as a sum of <q>signed</q> volumes of boxes, with a
            negative sign attached to those boxes whose heights are below the
            <m>xy</m>-plane.

            <figure xml:id="F_11_1_signed"><caption>The integral measures signed volume.</caption><sidebyside widths="50% 50%"><image source="images/fig_11_1_signed_graph"/><image source="images/fig_11_1_signed_volume"/></sidebyside></figure>

            We can then realize the double integral <m>\iint_R
            f(x,y) \, dA</m> as a difference in volumes<idx><h>double
              integral</h><h>difference in volumes</h></idx>: <m>\iint_R f(x,y) \, dA</m> tells us
            the volume of the solids the graph of <m>f</m> bounds above the <m>xy</m>-plane
            over the rectangle <m>R</m> minus the volume of the solids the graph of <m>f</m>
            bounds below the <m>xy</m>-plane under the rectangle <m>R</m>.  This is shown on
            the right of <xref ref="F_11_1_signed">Figure</xref>.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            The average of the finitely many <m>mn</m> values <m>f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*)</m> that we take in a double Riemann sum is given by
            <me>
              \mbox{Avg} _{mn} = \frac{1}{mn} \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*).
            </me>
            If we take the limit as <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> go to infinity, we obtain what we define as the average value<idx><h>double integral</h><h>average value</h></idx> of <m>f</m> over the region <m>R</m>, which is connected to the value of the double integral. First, to view <m>\text{ Avg } _{mn}</m> as a double Riemann sum, note that
            <me>
              \Delta x = \frac{b-a}{m} \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ \Delta y = \frac{d-c}{n}.
            </me>
            Thus,
            <me>
              \frac{1}{mn} = \frac{\Delta x \cdot \Delta y}{(b-a)(d-c)} = \frac{\Delta A}{A(R)},
            </me>
            where <m>A(R)</m> denotes the area of the rectangle <m>R</m>. Then, the average value of the function <m>f</m> over <m>R</m>, <m>f_{\operatorname{AVG}(R)}</m>, is given by
            <md><mrow>f_{\operatorname{AVG}(R)} \amp  = \lim_{m,n \to \infty} \frac{1}{mn} \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*)</mrow><mrow>\amp  = \lim_{m,n \to \infty} \frac{1}{A(R)} \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*) \cdot \Delta A</mrow><mrow>\amp  = \frac{1}{A(R)} \iint_R f(x,y) \, dA.</mrow></md>
            Therefore, the double integral of <m>f</m> over <m>R</m> divided by the area of <m>R</m> gives us the average value of the function <m>f</m> on <m>R</m>. Finally, if <m>f(x, y) \geq  0</m> on <m>R</m>, we can interpret this average value of <m>f</m> on <m>R</m> as the height of the box with base <m>R</m> that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by <m>f</m> over <m>R</m>.

      We conclude this section with a list of properties of double integrals. Since similar properties are satisfied by single-variable integrals and the arguments for double integrals are essentially the same, we omit their justification.

              Choose a point <m>(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*)</m> in each rectangle <m>R_{ij}</m>. Then a double Riemann sum for <m>f</m> over <m>R</m> is given by
              <me>
                \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*) \cdot \Delta A.

              Dividing the double integral of <m>f</m> over <m>R</m> by the area of <m>R</m> gives us the average value of the function <m>f</m> on <m>R</m>. If <m>f(x, y) \geq  0</m> on <m>R</m>, we can interpret this average value of <m>f</m> on <m>R</m> as the height of the box with base <m>R</m> that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by <m>f</m> over <m>R</m>.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      If we take the partition of <m>R</m> consisting of just <m>R</m> itself, we
      get
      <me>\mbox{Lower bound }= \mbox{min}_R f\cdot A_R=0\cdot (2-0)(2-0)=0.</me>
      Similarly, we get
      <me>\mbox{Upper bound } = \hbox{max}_R f\cdot A_R = \frac{2}{\sqrt3}\cdot (2-0)(2-0)=\frac{8}{\sqrt3}.</me><alert>(b)</alert>
      The estimates asked for are just the upper and lower
      sums.  We partition <m>R</m> into subrectangles <m>R_{(a,b)}</m> of
      width 1 and height 1, where <m>(a,b)</m> is the lower-left
      corner of <m>R_{(a,b)}</m>.
      The subrectangles are then <m>R_{(0,0)}</m>, <m>R_{(1,0)}</m>,
      <m>R_{(0,2)}</m>, and <m>R_{(2,2)}</m>.
      Then we find the lower sum
      <me>\mbox{Lower } =\sum_{(a,b)}A_{R_{(a,b)}}\cdot\min_{R_{(a,b)}}f
          = \sum_{(a,b)} 1\cdot (\mbox{Min of }f \mbox{ on }R_{(a,b)}).</me>
      The minimum occurs at the lower-left corner of each rectangle, so
      <me>\mbox{Lower } = 1\cdot( f(0,0) + f(1,0) + f(0,1) + f(1,1) )
        = 8.</me>

      Similarly, the upper sum is
      <me>\mbox{Upper } = 1\sum_{(a,b)}(\mbox{Max of }f \mbox{ on }R_{(a,b)}),</me>
      so
      <me>\mbox{Upper } = 1(f(2,2)+f(4,2)+f(2,4)+f(4,4)) = 1(\sqrt3 + 2\sqrt{\frac23}).</me>
      The upper sum is an overestimate and the lower sum is an
      underestimate, so we can get a better estimate by averaging them
      to get <m>1(\frac2{\sqrt3} + \sqrt{\frac23})</m>.

      <answer><p><m>0.25\cdot 1.5\cdot 136.5</m></p></answer>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      Partition <m>R</m> into subrectangles with the lines <m>x=0</m>, <m>x=0.25</m>,
      <m>x=0.5</m>, <m>x=0.75</m>, and <m>x=1</m> and the lines <m>y=0</m>,
      <m>y=1.5</m>, <m>y=3</m>, <m>y=4.5</m>, and <m>y=6</m>. Then we have 16
      subrectangles, each of which we denote <m>R_{(a,b)}</m>, where <m>(a,b)</m> is
      the location of the lower-left corner of the subrectangle.




      We want to find a lower bound and an upper bound for the volume above
      each subrectangle.  The lower bound for the volume of <m>R_{(a,b)}</m> is
      <me>0.375 ( \mbox{Min of } f \mbox{ on } R_{(a,b)})</me>
      because the area of <m>R_{(a,b)}</m> is
      <m>0.25\cdot 1.5=0.375</m>.  The function <m>f(x,y) = 6+3xy</m>
      increases with both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> over the whole region <m>R</m>.
      Thus,
      <me>\mbox{Min of } f \mbox{ on } R_{(a,b)} = f(a,b) = 6+3ab,</me>
      because the minimum on each subrectangle is at the corner closest to
      the origin.




      Similarly,
      <me>\mbox{Max of } f \mbox{ on } R_{(a,b)} =
          f(a+0.25,b+1.5) = 6 + 3(a+0.25)(b+1.5).</me>
      So we have
      <me>\mbox{Lower sum } = \sum_{(a,b)} 0.375(6+3ab) = 0.375 \sum_{(a,b)} 6+3ab
        = 36 + 0.375\sum_{(a,b)}3 ab</me>
      Since <m>a=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75</m> and <m>b= 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5</m>,
      expanding this sum gives
      <me>\mbox{Lower} = 36 + 0.375 (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1.125 + 2.25 + 3.375 + 0 + 2.25 + 4.5</me><me>+ 6.75 + 0 + 3.375 + 6.75 + 10.125) = 51.1875.</me>




      Similarly, we can compute the upper sum:
      <me>\mbox{Upper sum }= \sum_{(a,b)}0.375(6+3(a+0.25)(b+1.5))
          = 0.375\sum_{(a,b)}(6+3(a+0.25)(b+1.5))</me><me>= 36 + 0.375\sum_{(a,b)}(a+0.25)(b+1.5) = 78.1875.</me></solution>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      Let's break up the room into 25 sections, each  of which
      is 1 meter by 1 meter and has area <m>\Delta A=1</m>.




      We shall begin our sum as an upper estimate starting with the lower left
      corner of the room and continue across the bottom and
      moving upward using the highest temperature, <m>T_i</m>, in each case. So the
      upper Riemann sum becomes
      <me>\sum_{i=1}^{25} T_i \Delta A = T_1 \Delta A + T_2 \Delta A
      + T_3 \Delta A + \cdots + T_{25} \Delta A</me><me>= \Delta A (T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + \cdots + T_{25}).</me>
      Thus, taking the maximum value for each region (and, where the temperatures
      are not bounded in the box, taking the largest value plus one), we have
      <me>\mbox{sum} = (1)(23 + 24 + 24 + 25 + 25 + 24 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 26 + 26 + 26 + 27 + 27 + 27</me><me>+ 27 + 28 + 28 + 28 + 28 + 29 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 29) = 667.</me>




      In the same way, the lower Riemann sum is formed by taking the lowest
      temperature (and, where the temperatures are not bounded in the box,
      taking the largest value minus one), <m>t_i</m>, in each case:
      <me>\sum_{i=1}^{25} t_i \Delta A = t_1 \Delta A + t_2 \Delta A
      + t_3 \Delta A + \cdots + t_{25} \Delta A</me><me>= \Delta A (t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + \cdots + t_{25}).</me>
      Thus, taking the minimum value for each region, we have
      <me>\mbox{sum} = (1)(20 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 24 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 24 + 25 + 24 + 24 + 25 + 25 + 25</me><me>+ 25 + 26 + 26 + 27 + 27 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 28 + 27) = 621.</me>




      So, averaging the upper and lower sums we get: <m>644</m>.




      To compute the average temperature, we divide by the area of the room,
      <me>\mbox{Average temperature} = \frac{644}{25} = 25.76.</me>
      That is, approximately <m>25.76^{\circ}</m>C.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      We can mark the values of the function on the plane, as shown in
      the figure below, so that we can guess respectively at the
      smallest and largest values the function takes on each small rectangle.




      <sidebyside widths="41.6666666666667%"><image source="images/webwork-187-image-1.png"/></sidebyside>




      Then we can calculate the lower and upper sum by taking the smallest
      and largest values on each rectangle:
      <me>\mbox{Riemann sum} = \sum f(x_i,y_i)\Delta x\Delta y,</me>
      so the lower sum is
      <me>\mbox{Lower} = (5 + 7 + 3 + 5)(0.3)(0.4) = (20)(0.3)(0.4) = 2.4,</me>
      and the upper sum is
      <me>\mbox{Upper} = (9 + 12 + 7 + 18)(0.3)(0.4) = (46)(0.3)(0.4) = 5.52.</me></solution>

              How do we evaluate a double integral over a rectangle as an iterated integral, and why does this process work?

        <introduction>
          <p>
      Recall that we defined the double integral of a continuous function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> over a rectangle <m>R = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m> as
      <me>
        \iint_R f(x,y) \, dA = \lim_{m,n \to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m f\left(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*\right) \cdot \Delta A,
      </me>
      where the different variables and notation are as described in <xref ref="S-11-1-Double-Integrals-Rectangles">Section</xref>. Thus <m>\iint_R f(x,y) \, dA</m> is a limit of double Riemann sums, but while this definition tells us exactly what a double integral is, it is not very helpful for determining the value of a double integral. Fortunately, there is a way to view a double integral as an <em>iterated integral</em><idx><h>iterated integral</h><h>rectangular coordinates</h></idx>, which will make computations feasible in many cases.
    </p>
          <p>
      The viewpoint of an iterated integral is closely connected to an important idea from single-variable calculus. When we studied solids of revolution, such as the one shown in <xref ref="F_6_2_Ex1">Figure</xref>, we saw that in some circumstances we could slice the solid perpendicular to an axis and have each slice be approximately a circular disk. From there, we were able to find the volume of each disk, and then use an integral to add the volumes of the slices. In what follows, we are able to use single integrals to generalize this approach to handle even more general geometric shapes.

        Let <m>f(x,y) = 25-x^2-y^2</m> on the rectangular domain <m>R = [-3,3] \times [-4,4]</m>.

            <p>
        As with partial derivatives, we may treat one of the variables in <m>f</m> as constant and think of the resulting function as a function of a single variable. Now we investigate what happens if we integrate instead of differentiate.

          <title>Iterated Integrals</title>
          <p>
      The ideas that we explored in <xref ref="PA_11_2">Preview Activity</xref> work more generally and lead to the idea of an iterated integral. Let <m>f</m> be a continuous function on a rectangular domain <m>R = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m>, and let
      <me>
        A(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) \, dy.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      The function <m>A = A(x)</m> determines the value of the cross sectional area (by area we mean <q>signed</q> area) in the <m>y</m> direction for the fixed value of <m>x</m> of the solid bounded between the surface defined by <m>f</m> and the <m>xy</m>-plane.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_11_2_Cross_section_y_slab_sum">
            <caption>Summing volumes of cross section slices.</caption>
            <sidebyside widths="33% 33% 33%">
              <image source="images/fig_11_2_preview_animate_0"/>
              <image source="images/fig_11_2_preview_animate_2"/>
              <image source="images/fig_11_2_preview_animate_5"/>
            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      The value of this cross sectional area is determined by the input <m>x</m> in <m>A</m>. Since <m>A</m> is a function of <m>x</m>, it follows that we can integrate <m>A</m> with respect to <m>x</m>. In doing so, we use a partition of <m>[a, b]</m> and make an approximation to the integral given by
      <me>
        \int_a^b A(x) \, dx  \approx \sum_{i=1}^m A(x_i^*) \Delta x,
      </me>
      where <m>x_i^*</m> is any number in the subinterval <m>[x_{i-1},x_i]</m>. Each term <m>A(x_i^*) \Delta x</m> in the sum represents an approximation of a fixed cross sectional slice of the surface in the <m>y</m> direction with a fixed width of <m>\Delta x</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="F_11_2_Cross_section_y_slab_sum">Figure</xref>. We add the signed volumes of these slices as shown in the frames in <xref ref="F_11_2_Cross_section_y_slab_sum">Figure</xref> to obtain an approximation of the total signed volume.
    </p>
          <p>
      As we let the number of subintervals in the <m>x</m> direction approach infinity, we can see that the Riemann sum <m>\sum_{i=1}^m A(x_i^*) \Delta x</m>
      approaches a limit and that limit is the sum of signed volumes bounded by the function <m>f</m> on <m>R</m>. Therefore, since <m>A(x)</m> is itself determined by an integral, we have
      <me>
        \iint_R f(x,y) \, dA = \lim_{m \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^m A(x_i^*) \Delta x = \int_a^b A(x) \, dx = \int_a^b \left( \int_c^d f(x,y) \, dy \right) \, dx.

      Hence, we can compute the double integral of <m>f</m> over <m>R</m> by first integrating <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m> on <m>[c, d]</m>, then integrating the resulting function of <m>x</m> with respect to <m>x</m> on <m>[a, b]</m>. The nested integral
      <me>
        \int_a^b \left( \int_c^d f(x,y) \, dy \right) \, dx = \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) \, dy \, dx
      </me>
      is called an <em>iterated integral</em>, and we see that each double integral may be represented by two single integrals.
    </p>
          <p>
      We made a choice to integrate first with respect to <m>y</m>. The same argument shows that we can also find the double integral as an iterated integral integrating with respect to <m>x</m> first, or

        \iint_R f(x,y) \, dA = \int_c^d \left( \int_a^b f(x,y) \, dx \right) \, dy = \int_c^d  \int_a^b f(x,y) \, dx  \, dy.

      The fact that integrating in either order results in the same value is known as Fubini's Theorem.

      Fubini's theorem enables us to evaluate iterated integrals without resorting to the limit definition. Instead, working with one integral at a time, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus from single-variable calculus to find the exact value of each integral, starting with the inner integral.

          <ul>
            <li>
      <p>
        We can evaluate the double integral <m>\iint_R f(x,y) \, dA</m> over a rectangle <m>R = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m> as an iterated integral in one of two ways:
        <ul><li>
            <title>-</title>
            <p>
              <m>\int_a^b \left( \int_c^d f(x,y) \, dy \right) \, dx</m>, or
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <title>-</title>
            <p>
              <m>\int_c^d \left( \int_a^b f(x,y) \, dx \right) \, dy</m>.
            </p>
          </li></ul>
      

      This process works because each inner integral represents a cross-sectional (signed) area and the outer integral then sums all of the cross-sectional (signed) areas.  Fubini's Theorem guarantees that the resulting value is the same, regardless of the order in which we integrate.

      Recall that we defined the double integral of a continuous function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> over a rectangle <m>R = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m> as
      <me>
        \iint_R f(x,y) \, dA = \lim_{m,n \to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*) \cdot \Delta A,
      </me>
      where the notation is as described in <xref ref="S-11-1-Double-Integrals-Rectangles">Section</xref>. Furthermore, we have seen that we can evaluate a double integral <m>\iint_R f(x,y) \, dA</m> over <m>R</m> as an iterated integral of either of the forms
      <me>
        \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) \, dy \, dx \ \ \ \ \ \text{ or }  \ \ \ \ \ \int_c^d \int_a^b f(x,y) \, dx \, dy.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      It is natural to wonder how we might define and evaluate a double integral over a non-rectangular region; we explore one such example in the following preview activity.
    </p>
          <exploration xml:id="PA_11_3">
            <p>
        A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional figure with four faces, each of which is a triangle. A picture of the tetrahedron <m>T</m> with vertices <m>(0,0,0)</m>, <m>(1,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,1,0)</m>, and <m>(0,0,1)</m> is shown at left in <xref ref="F_11_3_Tetrahedron_PA">Figure</xref>. If we place one vertex at the origin and let vectors <m>\va</m>, <m>\vb</m>, and <m>\vc</m> be determined by the edges of the tetrahedron that have one end at the origin, then a formula that tells us the volume <m>V</m> of the tetrahedron is
        <men xml:id="eq_11_3_tetrahedron_volume">
          V = \frac{1}{6} \lvert \va \cdot (\vb \times \vc) \rvert.
        </men>
      </p>

              </sidebyside>
            </figure>
            <ol label="a.">
              <li>
          <p>
            Use the formula <xref ref="eq_11_3_tetrahedron_volume"/> to find the volume of the tetrahedron <m>T</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
              <li>
          <p>
            Instead of memorizing or looking up the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron, we can use a double integral to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron <m>T</m>. To see how, notice that the top face of the tetrahedron <m>T</m> is the plane whose equation is
            <me>
              z = 1-(x+y).
            </me>
            Provided that we can use an iterated integral on a non-rectangular region, the volume of the tetrahedron will be given by an iterated integral of the form
            <me>
              \int_{x=?}^{x=?} \int_{y=?}^{y=?} 1-(x+y) \, dy \, dx.
            </me>
            The issue that is new here is how we find the limits on the integrals; note that the outer integral's limits are in <m>x</m>, while the inner ones are in <m>y</m>, since we have chosen <m>dA = dy \, dx</m>. To see the domain over which we need to integrate, think of standing way above the tetrahedron looking straight down on it, which means we are projecting the entire tetrahedron onto the <m>xy</m>-plane. The resulting domain is the triangular region shown at right in <xref ref="F_11_3_Tetrahedron_PA">Figure</xref>. 


            Explain why we can represent the triangular region with the inequalities
            <me>
              0 \leq y \leq 1-x \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ 0 \leq x \leq 1.
            </me>
            (Hint: Consider the cross sectional slice shown at right in <xref ref="F_11_3_Tetrahedron_PA">Figure</xref>.)
          </p>
        </li>
              <li>
          <p>
            Explain why it makes sense to now write
            the volume integral in the form
            <me>
              \int_{x=?}^{x=?} \int_{y=?}^{y=?} 1-(x+y) \, dy \, dx = \int_{x=0}^{x=1} \int_{y=0}^{y=1-x} 1-(x+y) \, dy \, dx.
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
              <li>
          <p>
            Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the iterated integral
            <me>
              \int_{x=0}^{x=1} \int_{y=0}^{y=1-x} 1-(x+y) \, dy \, dx
            </me>
            and compare to your result from part (a).  (As with iterated integrals over rectangular regions, start with the inner integral.)

          <title>Double Integrals over General Regions</title>
          <p>
      So far, we have learned that a double integral over a rectangular region may be interpreted in one of two ways:
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            <m>\iint_R f(x,y) \, dA</m> tells us the volume of the solids the graph of <m>f</m> bounds above the <m>xy</m>-plane over the rectangle <m>R</m> minus the volume of the solids the graph of <m>f</m> bounds below the <m>xy</m>-plane under the rectangle <m>R</m>;

            <m>\frac{1}{A(R)} \iint_R f(x,y) \, dA</m>, where <m>A(R)</m> is the area of <m>R</m> tells us the average value of the function <m>f</m> on <m>R</m>. If <m>f(x, y) \geq  0</m> on <m>R</m>, we can interpret this average value of <m>f</m> on <m>R</m> as the height of the box with base <m>R</m> that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by <m>f</m> over <m>R</m>.

          <p>
      As we saw in <xref ref="PA_11_1">Preview Activity</xref>, a function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> may be considered over regions other than rectangular ones, and thus we want to understand how to set up and evaluate double integrals over non-rectangular regions. Note that if we can, then the two interpretations of the double integral noted above will naturally extend to solid regions with non-rectangular bases.
    </p>
          <p>
      So, suppose <m>f</m> is a continuous function on a closed, bounded domain <m>D</m>. For example, consider <m>D</m> as the circular domain shown at left in <xref ref="F_11_3_nonrect_domain_1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_11_3_nonrect_domain_1">
            <caption>Left: A non-rectangular domain. Right: Enclosing this domain in a rectangle.</caption>
            <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">

            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
          <p>
      We can enclose <m>D</m> in a rectangular domain <m>R</m> as shown at right in <xref ref="F_11_3_nonrect_domain_1">Figure</xref> and extend the function <m>f</m> to be defined over <m>R</m> in order to be able to use the definition of the double integral over a rectangle. We extend <m>f</m> in such a way that its values at the points in <m>R</m> that are not in <m>D</m> contribute 0 to the value of the integral. In other words, define a function <m>F = F(x, y)</m> on <m>R</m> as
      <me>
        F(x,y) = \begin{cases}f(x,y), \amp \text{ if }  (x,y) \in D, \\ 0, \amp \text{ if }  (x,y) \not\in D
        \end{cases} .
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      We then say that the double integral of <m>f</m> over <m>D</m><idx><h>double integral over a general region</h></idx> is the same as the double integral of <m>F</m> over <m>R</m>, and thus
      <me>
        \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA = \iint_R F(x,y) \, dA.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      In practice, we just ignore everything that is in <m>R</m> but not in <m>D</m>, since these regions contribute 0 to the value of the integral.
    </p>
          <p>
      Just as with double integrals over rectangles, a double integral over a domain <m>D</m> can be evaluated as an iterated integral. If the region <m>D</m> can be described by the inequalities <m>g_1(x) \leq y \leq g_2(x)</m> and <m>a \leq x \leq b</m>, where <m>g_1=g_1(x)</m> and <m>g_2=g_2(x)</m> are functions of only <m>x</m>, then
      <me>
        \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA = \int_{x=a}^{x=b} \int_{y=g_1(x)}^{y=g_2(x)} f(x,y) \, dy \, dx.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Alternatively, if the region <m>D</m> is described by the inequalities <m>h_1(y) \leq x \leq h_2(y)</m> and <m>c \leq y \leq d</m>, where <m>h_1=h_1(y)</m> and <m>h_2=h_2(y)</m> are functions of only <m>y</m>, we have
      <me>
        \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA = \int_{y=c}^{y=d} \int_{x=h_1(y)}^{x=h_2(y)} f(x,y) \, dx \, dy.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      The structure of an iterated integral is of particular note:
    </p>
          <p>
      In an iterated double integral:
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            the limits on the outer integral must be constants;
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            the limits on the inner integral must be constants or in terms of only the remaining variable <mdash/> that is, if the inner integral is with respect to <m>y</m>, then its limits may only involve <m>x</m> and constants, and vice versa.
          </p>
        </li></ul>
    </p>
          <p>
      We next consider a detailed example.

              <p>
          To evaluate <m>\iint_D f(x,y) \, dA</m>, we must first describe the region <m>D</m> in terms of the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. We take two approaches.
          <dl><li>
              <title>Approach 1: Integrate first with respect to <m>y</m>.</title>
              <p>
                In this case we choose to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in the form
                <me>
                  \iint_D x^2y \, dA = \int_{x=a}^{x=b} \int_{y=g_1(x)}^{y=g_2(x)} x^2y \, dy \, dx,
                </me>
                and therefore we need to describe <m>D</m> in terms of inequalities
                <me>
                  g_1(x) \leq y \leq g_2(x) \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ a \leq x \leq b.
                </me>
                Since we are integrating with respect to <m>y</m> first, the iterated integral has the form
                <me>
                  \iint_D x^2y \, dA =\int_{x=a}^{x=b} A(x) \, dx,
                </me>
                where <m>A(x)</m> is a cross sectional area in the <m>y</m> direction. So we are slicing the domain perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis and want to understand what a cross sectional area of the overall solid will look like. Several slices of the domain are shown in the middle image in <xref ref="F_11_3_DI_1">Figure</xref>. On a slice with fixed <m>x</m> value, the <m>y</m> values are bounded below by 0 and above by the <m>y</m> coordinate on the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Thus, <m>g_1(x) = 0</m>;  to find <m>y = g_2(x)</m>, we need to write the hypotenuse as a function of <m>x</m>. The hypotenuse connects the points (0,0) and (2,3) and hence has equation <m>y = \frac{3}{2}x</m>. This gives the upper bound on <m>y</m> as <m>g_2(x) = \frac{3}{2}x</m>. The leftmost vertical cross section is at <m>x=0</m> and the rightmost one is at <m>x=2</m>, so we have <m>a=0</m> and <m>b=2</m>. Therefore,
                <me>
                  \iint_D x^2y \, dA = \int_{x=0}^{x=2} \int_{y=0}^{y = \frac32 x} x^2y \, dy \, dx.
                </me>
                We evaluate the iterated integral by applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus first to the inner integral, and then to the outer one, and find that
                <md><mrow>\int_{x=0}^{x=2} \int_{y=0}^{y=\frac32 x} x^2y \, dy \, dx \amp = \int_{x=0}^{x=2} \left[x^2 \cdot \frac{y^2}{2}\right]\biggm|_{y=0}^{y=\frac32 x} \, dx</mrow><mrow>\amp = \int_{x=0}^{x=2} \frac{9}{8}x^4\, dx</mrow><mrow>\amp = \frac{9}{8}\frac{x^5}{5}\biggm|_{x=0}^{x=2}</mrow><mrow>\amp = \left(\frac{9}{8}\right) \left(\frac{32}{5}\right)</mrow><mrow>\amp = \frac{36}{5}.</mrow></md>

              <p>
                In this case, we choose to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in the form
                <me>
                  \iint_D x^2y \, dA = \int_{y=c}^{y=d} \int_{x=h_1(y)}^{x=h_2(y)} x^2y \, dx \, dy
                </me>
                and thus need to describe <m>D</m> in terms of inequalities
                <me>
                  h_1(y) \leq x \leq h_2(y) \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }   \ \ \ \ \  c \leq y \leq d.
                </me>
                Since we are integrating with respect to <m>x</m> first, the iterated integral has the form
                <me>
                  \iint_D x^2y \, dA = \int_c^d A(y) \, dy,
                </me>
                where <m>A(y)</m> is a cross sectional area of the solid in the <m>x</m> direction.  Several slices of the domain <mdash/> perpendicular to the <m>y</m>-axis <mdash/> are shown at right in <xref ref="F_11_3_DI_1">Figure</xref>.

                On a slice with fixed <m>y</m> value, the <m>x</m> values are bounded below by the <m>x</m> coordinate on the hypotenuse of the right triangle and above by 2. So <m>h_2(y) = 2</m>; to find <m>h_1(y)</m>, we need to write the hypotenuse as a function of <m>y</m>. Solving the earlier equation we have for the hypotenuse (<m>y = \frac32 x</m>) for <m>x</m> gives us <m>x = \frac{2}{3}y</m>. This makes <m>h_1(y) = \frac{2}{3}y</m>. The lowest horizontal cross section is at <m>y=0</m> and the uppermost one is at <m>y=3</m>, so we have <m>c=0</m> and <m>d=3</m>. Therefore,
                <me>
                  \iint_D x^2y \, dA = \int_{y=0}^{y=3} \int_{x=(2/3)y}^{x=2} x^2y \, dx \, dy.
                </me>
                We evaluate the resulting iterated integral as before by twice applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and find that

          We see, of course, that in the situation where <m>D</m> can be described in two different ways, the order in which we choose to set up and evaluate the double integral doesn't matter, and the same value results in either case.

          In an iterated double integral, the limits on the outer integral must be constants while the limits on the inner integral must be constants or in terms of only the remaining variable. In other words, an iterated double integral has one of the following forms (which result in the same value):

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      The contour <m>f(x,y)=1</m> lies in the <m>xy</m>-plane and has equation
      <me>8 e^{-(x-3)^2-y^2} = 1,</me>
      so
      <me>-(x-3)^2-y^2 = \ln (1/8),\quad\mbox{or}\quad
        (x-3)^2+y^2 = \ln 8.</me>
      This is the equation of a circle of radius <m>\sqrt{\ln(8)}</m>
      centered at <m>(3,0)</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane.  Similarly, for
      <m>k \lt  8</m>, we have that the contours <m>f(x,y) = k</m> are the
      circles
      <m>(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = \ln(8/k)</m>, all of which are centered on
      <m>(3,0)</m>.




      <alert>(b)</alert>
      The cross-section has equation <m>z=f(3,y)=8 e^{-y^2}</m>.  If <m>x=3</m>, the
      base region in the <m>xy</m>-plane extends from <m>y=-\sqrt{7}</m> to
      <m>y=\sqrt{7}</m>.  Thus the area is
      <me>\hbox{Area } = \int_{-\sqrt{7}}^{\sqrt{7}}8 e^{-y^2}\,dy.</me><alert>(c)</alert>
      Using this idea and slicing parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis, we get
      <me>\hbox{Volume } =
      \int_{-4}^{4}\int_{-\sqrt{16-x^2}}^{\sqrt{16-x^2}}
        8 e^{-(x-3)^2-y^2}\,dy\,dx.</me></solution>

          <p>
      So far, we have interpreted the double integral of a function <m>f</m> over a domain <m>D</m> in two different ways. First, <m>\iint_D f(x,y) \, dA</m> tells us a difference of volumes <mdash/> the volume the surface defined by <m>f</m> bounds above the <m>xy</m>-plane on <m>D</m> minus the volume the surface bounds below the <m>xy</m>-plane on <m>D</m>. In addition, <m>\frac{1}{A(D)} \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA</m> determines the average value of <m>f</m> on <m>D</m>. In this section, we investigate several other applications of double integrals, using the integration process as seen in <xref ref="PA_11_4">Preview Activity</xref>: we partition into small regions, approximate the desired quantity on each small region, then use the integral to sum these values exactly in the limit.
    </p>
          <p>
      The following preview activity explores how a double integral can be used to determine the density of a thin plate with a mass density distribution. Recall that in single-variable calculus, we considered a similar problem and computed the mass of a one-dimensional rod with a mass-density distribution. There, as here, the key idea is that if density is constant, mass is the product of density and volume.

            <p>
        Suppose that we have a flat, thin object (called a <term>lamina</term>) whose density varies across the object. We can think of the density on a lamina as a measure of mass per unit area. As an example, consider a circular plate <m>D</m> of radius 1 cm centered at the origin whose density <m>\delta</m> varies depending on the distance from its center so that the density in grams per square centimeter at point <m>(x, y)</m> is
        <me>
          \delta(x,y) = 10-2(x^2+y^2).

              Determine an iterated integral which, if evaluated, would give the exact mass of the plate.  Do not actually evaluate the integral.

          <title>Mass</title>
          <p>
      Density is a measure of some quantity per unit area or volume. For example, we can measure the human population density of some region as the number of humans in that region divided by the area of that region. In physics, the mass density of an object is the mass of the object per unit area or volume. As suggested by <xref ref="PA_11_4">Preview Activity</xref>, the following holds in general.

          <title>Area</title>
          <p>
      If we consider the situation where the mass-density distribution is constant, we can also see how a double integral may be used to determine the area of a region. Assuming that <m>\delta(x,y) = 1</m> over a closed bounded region <m>D</m>, where the units of <m>\delta</m> are <q>mass per unit of area,</q> it follows that <m>\iint_D 1 \, dA</m> is the mass of the lamina. But since the density is constant, the numerical value of the integral is simply the area.

          <p>
      As the following activity demonstrates, we can also see this fact by considering a three-dimensional solid whose height is always 1.

          <title>Center of Mass</title>
          <p>
      The center of mass of an object is a point at which the object will balance perfectly. For example, the center of mass of a circular disk of uniform density is located at its center. For any object, if we throw it through the air, it will spin around its center of mass and behave as if all the mass is located at the center of mass.
    </p>
          <p>
      In order to understand the role that integrals play in determining the center of a mass of an object with a nonuniform mass distribution, we start by finding the center of mass of a collection of <m>N</m> distinct point-masses in the plane.
    </p>
          <p>
      Let <m>m_1</m>, <m>m_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>m_N</m> be <m>N</m> masses located in the plane. Think of these masses as connected by rigid rods of negligible weight from some central point <m>(x,y)</m>. A picture with four masses is shown in <xref ref="F_11_4_COM">Figure</xref>. Now imagine balancing this system by placing it on a thin pole at the point <m>(x,y)</m> perpendicular to the plane containing the masses. Unless the masses are perfectly balanced, the system will fall off the pole. The point <m>(\overline{x}, \overline{y})</m> at which the system will balance perfectly is called the <em>center of mass</em> of the system. Our goal is to determine the center of mass of a system of discrete masses, then extend this to a continuous lamina.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_11_4_COM">
            <caption>A center of mass <m>(\overline{x}, \overline{y})</m> of four masses.</caption>
            <image width="50%" source="images/fig_11_4_masses"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      Each mass exerts a force (called a <em>moment</em>) around the lines <m>x=\overline{x}</m> and <m>y=\overline{y}</m> that causes the system to tilt in the direction of the mass. These moments are dependent on the mass and the distance from the given line. Let <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> be the location of mass <m>m_1</m>, <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> the location of mass <m>m_2</m>, etc. In order to balance perfectly, the moments in the <m>x</m> direction and in the <m>y</m> direction must be in equilibrium. We determine these moments and solve the resulting system to find the equilibrium point <m>(\overline{x}, \overline{y})</m> at the center of mass.
    </p>
          <p>
      The force that mass <m>m_1</m> exerts to tilt the system from the line <m>y=\overline{y}</m> is
      <me>
        m_1g(\overline{y} - y_1),
      </me>
      where <m>g</m> is the gravitational constant. Similarly, the force mass <m>m_2</m> exerts to tilt the system from the line <m>y= \overline{y}</m> is
      <me>
        m_2g(\overline{y}-y_2).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      In general, the force that mass <m>m_k</m> exerts to tilt the system from the line <m>y= \overline{y}</m> is
      <me>
        m_kg(\overline{y}-y_k).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      For the system to balance, we need the forces to sum to 0, so that
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^N m_kg(\overline{y}-y_k) = 0.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Solving for <m>\overline{y}</m>, we find that
      <me>
        \overline{y} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^N m_ky_k}{\sum_{k=1}^N m_k}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      A similar argument shows that
      <me>
        \overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^N m_kx_k}{\sum_{k=1}^N m_k}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      The value <m>M_x~=~\sum_{k=1}^N m_ky_k</m> is called the <em>total moment</em> with respect to the <m>x</m>-axis; <m>M_y~=~\sum_{k=1}^N m_kx_k</m> is the <em>total moment</em> with respect to the <m>y</m>-axis. Hence, the respective quotients of the moments to the total mass, <m>M</m>, determines the center of mass of a point-mass system:
      <me>
        (\overline{x}, \overline{y}) = \left(\frac{M_y}{M}, \frac{M_x}{M}\right).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Now, suppose that rather than a point-mass system, we have a continuous lamina with a variable mass-density <m>\delta(x, y)</m>. We may estimate its center of mass by partitioning the lamina into <m>mn</m> subrectangles of equal area <m>\Delta A</m>, and treating the resulting partitioned lamina as a point-mass system. In particular, we select a point <m>(x_{ij}^*,y_{ij}^*)</m> in the <m>ij</m>th subrectangle, and observe that the quanity
      <me>
        \delta(x_{ij}^*,y_{ij}^*) \Delta A
      </me>
      is density times area, so <m>\delta(x_{ij}^*,y_{ij}^*) \Delta A</m> approximates the mass of the small portion of the lamina determined by the subrectangle <m>R_{ij}</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      We now treat <m>\delta(x_{ij}^*,y_{ij}^*) \Delta A</m> as a point mass at the point <m>(x_{ij}^*,y_{ij}^*)</m>. The coordinates <m>(\overline{x}, \overline{y})</m> of the center of mass of these <m>mn</m> point masses are thus given by
      <me>
        \overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m x_{ij}^*\delta(x_{ij}^*,y_{ij}^*) \Delta A}{\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^m \delta(x_{ij}^*,y_{ij}^*) \Delta A} \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ \overline{y} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m y_{ij}^*\delta(x_{ij}^*,y_{ij}^*) \Delta A}{\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^m \delta(x_{ij}^*,y_{ij}^*) \Delta A}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      If we take the limit as <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> go to infinity, we obtain the exact center of mass <m>(\overline{x}, \overline{y})</m> of the continuous lamina.

          <title>Probability</title>
          <p>
      Calculating probabilities is a very important application of integration in the physical, social, and life sciences. To understand the basics, consider the game of darts in which a player throws a dart at a board and tries to hit a particular target. Let us suppose that a dart board is in the form of a disk <m>D</m> with radius 10 inches. If we assume that a player throws a dart at random, and is not aiming at any particular point, then it is equally probable that the dart will strike any single point on the board. For instance, the probability that the dart will strike a particular 1 square inch region is <m>\frac{1}{100 \pi}</m>, or the ratio of the area of the desired target to the total area of <m>D</m> (assuming that the dart thrower always hits the board itself at some point). Similarly, the probability that the dart strikes a point in the disk <m>D_3</m> of radius 3 inches is given by the area of <m>D_3</m> divided by the area of <m>D</m>. In other words, the probability that the dart strikes the disk <m>D_3</m> is
      <me>
        \frac{9 \pi}{100\pi} = \iint_{D_3} \frac{1}{100 \pi} \, dA.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      The integrand, <m>\frac{1}{100\pi}</m>, may be thought of as a <em>distribution function</em>, describing how the dart strikes are distributed across the board. In this case the distribution function is constant since we are assuming a uniform distribution, but we can easily envision situations where the distribution function varies. For example, if the player is fairly good and is aiming for the bulls eye (the center of <m>D</m>), then the distribution function <m>f</m> could be skewed toward the center, say
      <me>
        f(x,y) = K e^{-(x^2+y^2)}
      </me>
      for some constant positive <m>K</m>. If we assume that the player is consistent enough so that the dart always strikes the board, then the probability that the dart strikes the board somewhere is 1, and the distribution function <m>f</m> will have to satisfy<fn>This makes <m>K = \frac{1}{\pi\left(1-e^{-100}\right)}</m>, which you can check.</fn>
      <me>
        \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA = 1.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      For such a function <m>f</m>, the probability that the dart strikes in the disk <m>D_1</m> of radius 1 would be
      <me>
        \iint_{D_1} f(x,y) \, dA.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Indeed, the probability that the dart strikes in any region <m>R</m> that lies within <m>D</m> is given by
      <me>
        \iint_R f(x,y) \, dA.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      The preceding discussion highlights the general idea behind calculating probabilities. We assume we have a <em>joint probability density function</em><idx><h>joint probability density function</h></idx> <m>f</m>, a function of two independent variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> defined on a domain <m>D</m> that satisfies the conditions
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            <m>f(x,y) \geq 0</m> for all <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>D</m>,
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            the probability that <m>x</m> is between some values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> while <m>y</m> is between some values <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> is given by
            <me>
              \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) \, dy \, dx,
            </me>
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            The probability<idx><h>double integral</h><h>probability</h></idx> that the point <m>(x,y)</m> is in <m>D</m> is 1, that is
            <men xml:id="eq_11_4_pdf">
              \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA = 1.

          </p>
        </li></ul>
    </p>
          <p>
      Note that it is possible that <m>D</m> could be an infinite region and the limits on the integral in Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_11_4_pdf"/> could be infinite. When we have such a probability density function <m>f=f(x,y)</m>, the probability that the point <m>(x,y)</m> is in some region <m>R</m> contained in the domain <m>D</m> (the notation we use here is <q><m>P((x,y)\in R)</m></q>) is determined by

        A firm manufactures smoke detectors. Two components for the detectors come from different suppliers <mdash/> one in Michigan and one in Ohio. The company studies these components for their reliability and their data suggests that if <m>x</m> is the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen component from the Michigan supplier and <m>y</m> the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen component from the Ohio supplier, then the joint probability density function <m>f</m> might be given by

              Theoretically, the components might last forever, so the domain <m>D</m> of the function <m>f</m> is the set <m>D</m> of all <m>(x,y)</m> such that <m>x \ge 0</m> and <m>y \ge 0</m>. To show that <m>f</m> is a probability density function on <m>D</m> we need to demonstrate that

              Assume that the smoke detector fails only if both of the supplied components fail. To determine the probability that a randomly selected detector will fail within one year, we will need to determine the probability that the life span of each component is between 0 and 1 years. Set up an appropriate iterated integral, and evaluate the integral to determine the probability.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert><m>p</m> is not a joint density function.  Since <m>p(x,y)=0</m> outside the
      region <m>R</m>, the volume under the graph of <m>p</m> is the same as the
      volume under the graph of <m>p</m> over the region <m>R</m>, which is
      <m>3</m>, not one, which it would have to be if <m>p(x,y)</m> were a joint density function..




      <alert>(b)</alert><m>p</m> is a joint density function.  Since <m>p(x,y)=0</m> outside the
      region <m>R</m>, the volume under the graph of <m>p</m> is the same as the
      volume under the graph of <m>p</m> over the region <m>R</m>, which is
      <m>1</m>, which is the value it must have if <m>p(x,y)</m> is a joint density function..




      Finally, for a constant function to be a joint density function on
      <m>R</m> given by <m>-1 \le x \le 3,
      0 \le y \le 3</m>, the volume under the constant
      must be one.  So, if <m>p(x,y) = k</m>, <m>12 k = 1</m>, so
      <m>p(x,y) = \frac1{12}</m>.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      The probability is
      <me>\int_0^1\int_{1/2}^1 {2 \over 3} (x + 2y) \,dx\,dy =

      = {2\over3} \left(\frac{3}{8} y + \frac{1}{2} y^2\right)\bigr|_0^1</me><me>= {2\over3} \left(\frac{7}{8}\right) = \frac{7}{12}.</me><alert>(b)</alert>
      It is easier to calculate the probability that <m>x \lt  \frac1{2} + y</m> does not
      happen,  that is, the probability that <m>x \ge \frac1{2} + y</m>, and subtract
      it from 1. The probability that <m>x \ge \frac1{2} + y</m> is
      <me>\int_{0}^{1/2}\int_{y+1/2}^{1} {2\over3} (x+2y) \,dx\,dy =
      \int_{0}^{1/2} (\frac13\,x^2 + \frac43\,xy) \bigr|_{y+(1/2)}^{1} \,dy</me><me>= \int_{0}^{1/2} \frac13\left(1 - (\frac1{2} + y)^2\right) +
          \frac43(y)(1 - (\frac1{2} + y)) \,dy</me><me>= \int_{0}^{1/2} -\frac53\,y^2 + \frac{1}{3} y + \frac{1}{4} \, dy</me><me>= (-\frac59\,y^3 + \frac{1}{6}\, y^2 + \frac{1}{4}\,y)\bigr|_{0}^{1/2}</me><me>= \frac{7}{72}.</me>
      Thus, the probability that <m>x \lt  \frac1{2}+y</m> is <m>1-(\frac{7}{72}) = \frac{65}{72}</m>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
      While we have naturally defined double integrals in the rectangular coordinate system, starting with domains that are rectangular regions, there are many of these integrals that are difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate. For example, consider the domain <m>D</m> that is the unit circle and <m>f(x,y) = e^{-x^2 - y^2}</m>. To integrate <m>f</m> over <m>D</m>, we would use the iterated integral
      <me>
        \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA = \int_{x = -1}^{x = 1} \int_{y = -\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{y = \sqrt{1-x^2}} e^{-x^2 - y^2} \, dy \, dx.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      For this particular integral, regardless of the order of integration, we are unable to find an antiderivative of the integrand; in addition, even if we were able to find an antiderivative, the inner limits of integration involve relatively complicated functions.
    </p>
          <p>
      It is useful, therefore, to be able to translate to other coordinate systems where the limits of integration and evaluation of the involved integrals is simpler. In this section we provide a quick discussion of one such system <mdash/> polar coordinates <mdash/> and then introduce and investigate their ramifications for double integrals. The rectangular coordinate system allows us to consider domains and graphs relative to a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an alternate coordinate system that allows us to consider domains less suited to rectangular coordinates, such as circles.

        The coordinates of a point determine its location. In particular, the rectangular coordinates of a point <m>P</m> are given by an ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m>, where <m>x</m> is the (signed) distance the point lies from the <m>y</m>-axis to <m>P</m> and <m>y</m> is the (signed) distance the point lies from the <m>x</m>-axis to <m>P</m>. In polar coordinates, we locate the point by considering the distance the point lies from the origin, <m>O = (0,0)</m>, and the angle the line segment from the origin to <m>P</m> forms with the positive <m>x</m>-axis.

      The rectangular coordinate system is best suited for graphs and regions that are naturally considered over a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an alternative that offers good options for functions and domains that have more circular characteristics. A point <m>P</m> in rectangular coordinates that is described by an ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m>, where <m>x</m> is the displacement from <m>P</m> to the <m>y</m>-axis and <m>y</m> is the displacement from <m>P</m> to the <m>x</m>-axis, as seen in <xref ref="PA_11_5">Preview Activity</xref>, can also be described with polar coordinates<idx><h>polar coordinates</h></idx> <m>(r,\theta)</m>, where <m>r</m> is the distance from <m>P</m> to the origin and <m>\theta</m> is the angle formed by the line segment <m>\overline{OP}</m> and the positive <m>x</m>-axis, as shown at left in <xref ref="F_11_5_Polar_coords">Figure</xref>.

      <em>Note:</em> The angle <m>\theta</m> in the polar coordinates of a point is not unique. We could replace <m>\theta</m> with <m>\theta  + 2 \pi</m> and still be at the same terminal point. In addition, the sign of <m>\tan(\theta)</m> does not uniquely determine the quadrant in which <m>\theta</m> lies, so we have to determine the value of <m>\theta</m> from the location of the point. In other words, more care has to be paid when using polar coordinates than rectangular coordinates. 
    </p>
          <p>
      We can draw graphs of curves in polar coordinates in a similar way to how we do in rectangular coordinates. However, when plotting in polar coordinates, we use a grid that considers changes in angles and changes in distance from the origin. In particular, the angles <m>\theta</m> and distances <m>r</m> partition the plane into small wedges as shown at right in <xref ref="F_11_5_Polar_coords">Figure</xref>.

          <title>Integrating in Polar Coordinates</title>
          <p>
      Consider the double integral
      <me>
        \iint_D e^{x^2+y^2} \, dA,
      </me>
      where <m>D</m> is the unit disk. While we cannot directly evaluate this integral in rectangular coordinates, a change to polar coordinates will convert it to one we can easily evaluate.
    </p>
          <p>
      We have seen how to evaluate a double integral <m>\displaystyle \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA</m> as an iterated integral of the form
      <me>
        \int_a^b \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} f(x,y) \, dy \, dx
      </me>
      in rectangular coordinates, because we know that <m>dA = dy \, dx</m> in rectangular coordinates. To make the change to polar coordinates, we not only need to represent the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in polar coordinates, but we also must understand how to write the area element, <m>dA</m>, in polar coordinates. That is, we must determine how the area element <m>dA</m> can be written in terms of <m>dr</m> and <m>d\theta</m> in the context of polar coordinates. We address this question in the following activity.

              Observe that the region <m>R</m> is only a portion of the annulus, so the area <m>\Delta A</m> of <m>R</m> is only a fraction of the area of the annulus.  For instance, if <m>\theta_{i+1} - \theta_i</m> were <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m>, then the resulting wedge would be

      From the result of <xref ref="A_11_5_3">Activity</xref>, we see when we convert an integral from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we must not only convert <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to being in terms of <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>, but we also have to change the area element to <m>dA = r \, dr \, d\theta</m> in polar coordinates. As we saw in <xref ref="A_11_5_3">Activity</xref>, the reason the additional factor of <m>r</m> in the polar area element is due to the fact that in polar coordinates, the cross sectional area element increases as <m>r</m> increases, while the cross sectional area element in rectangular coordinates is constant. So, given a double integral <m>\iint_D f(x,y) \, dA</m> in rectangular coordinates, to write a corresponding iterated integral in polar coordinates, we replace <m>x</m> with <m>r \cos(\theta)</m>, <m>y</m> with <m>r \sin(\theta)</m> and <m>dA</m> with <m>r \, dr \, d\theta</m>. Of course, we need to describe the region <m>D</m> in polar coordinates as well. To summarize:

          The disc <m>D</m> is described in polar coordinates by the constraints <m>0 \leq r \leq 1</m> and <m>0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi</m>. Therefore, it follows that
          <me>
            \iint_D e^{r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta = \int_{\theta=0}^{\theta = 2\pi} \int_{r=0}^{r=1} e^{r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
          </me>
        </p>
              <p>
          We can evaluate the resulting iterated polar integral as follows:
          <md><mrow>\int_{\theta=0}^{\theta = 2\pi} \int_{r=0}^{r=1} e^{r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta \amp = \int_{\theta=0}^{2\pi}  \left( \frac{1}{2}e^{r^2}\biggm|_{r=0}^{r=1} \right) \, d\theta</mrow><mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\theta=0}^{\theta = 2\pi} \left( e-1 \right) \, d\theta</mrow><mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{2}(e-1) \int_{\theta=0}^{\theta = 2\pi} \, d\theta</mrow><mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{2}(e-1)\left[\theta\right]\biggm|_{\theta=0}^{\theta = 2\pi}</mrow><mrow>\amp = \pi(e-1).</mrow></md>
        </p>
            </statement>

      While there is no firm rule for when polar coordinates can or should be used, they are a natural alternative anytime the domain of integration may be expressed simply in polar form, and/or when the integrand involves expressions such as <m>\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.</m>

          The polar representation of a point <m>P</m> is the ordered pair <m>(r,\theta)</m> where <m>r</m> is the distance from the origin to <m>P</m> and <m>\theta</m> is the angle the ray through the origin and <m>P</m> makes with the positive <m>x</m>-axis.

          The polar coordinates <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> of a point <m>(x,y)</m> in rectangular coordinates satisfy

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      In polar coordinates, <m>-\pi/4\le\theta\le\pi/4</m>.  Also,
      the outer (right) boundary of the region is
      <m>\sqrt{10} = x = r\cos\theta</m>. Hence,
      <m>0\le r\le \sqrt{10}/\cos\theta</m>. The integral
      becomes
      <me>\int_0^{\sqrt{10}}\int_{-x}^x\,dy\,dx
        =\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\int_0^{\sqrt{10}/\!\cos\theta}\,r\,dr\,d\theta.</me>
      Then
      <me>\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\int_0^{\sqrt{10}/\!\cos\theta}\,r\,dr\,d\theta
        = \int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\left(\frac{r^2}{2}\bigg|_0^{\sqrt{10}/\!\cos\theta}\right)\,d\theta
        = \int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\frac{5}{\cos^2\theta}\,d\theta.</me>
      And
      <me>\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\frac{5}{\cos^2\theta}\,d\theta
        =5 \tan\theta\bigg|_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4} = 5\cdot(1 - (-1)) = 10.</me>
      Notice that we can check this answer because the integral gives the
      area of the shaded triangular region which is <m>\frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{10}
      \cdot (2\sqrt{10}) = 10</m>.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      The curve <m>r=1/(4\cos\theta)</m>, or <m>r\cos\theta=1/4</m>, is the line
      <m>x = 1/4</m>.  The curve <m>r=1</m> is the circle of radius 1 centered
      at the origin.  This gives the graph




      <sidebyside widths="41.6666666666667%"><image source="images/webwork-229-image-1.png"/></sidebyside>




      The line intersects the circle where <m>4\cos\theta=1</m>, so
      <m>\theta = \pm\arccos(1/4)</m>.
      Thus
      <me>\hbox{Area }=\int_{-\arccos(1/4)}^{\arccos(1/4)}\int_{1/(4\cos\theta)}^1 r\,dr\,d\theta.</me>
      Evaluating gives
      <me>\hbox{Area }=
      \int_{-\arccos(1/4)}^{\arccos(1/4)}\left(\frac{r^2}{2}\bigg|_{1/(4\cos\theta)}^1\right)d\theta
        =\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\arccos(1/4)}^{\arccos(1/4)}\left(1-\frac{1}{16\cos^2\theta}\right)d\theta</me>
      so
      <me>\mbox{Area }=\frac{1}{2}\left(\theta -\frac{\tan\theta}{16}\right)
         \bigg|_{-\arccos(1/4)}^{\arccos(1/4)}
        =\frac{1}{2}\left(2(\arccos(1/4)) - 2\frac{\tan(\arccos(1/4))}{16}\right)</me><me>= \arccos(\frac1{4}) - \frac1{16}\,\tan(\arccos(\frac1{4})).</me></solution>

        <introduction>
          <p>
      We have now studied at length how curves in space can be defined parametrically by functions of the form <m>\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle</m>, and surfaces can be represented by functions <m>z = f(x,y)</m>. In what follows, we will see how we can also define surfaces parametrically. A one-dimensional curve in space results from a vector function that relies upon one parameter, so a two-dimensional surface naturally involves the use of two parameters. If <m>x = x(s, t)</m>, <m>y = y(s, t)</m>, and <m>z = z(s, t)</m> are functions of independent parameters <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, then the terminal points of all vectors of the form
      <me>
        \vr(s, t) = x(s, t) \vi + y(s, t) \vj + z(s, t) \vk
      </me>
      form a surface in space. The equations <m>x=x(s,t)</m>, <m>y=y(s,t)</m>, and <m>z=z(s,t)</m> are the <em>parametric equations</em><idx><h>parameterization</h><h>surface</h></idx> for the surface, or a <em>parametrization</em> of the surface. In <xref ref="PA_11_6">Preview Activity</xref> we investigate how to parameterize a cylinder and a cone.

              Just as a cylinder can be viewed as a <q>stack</q> of circles of constant radius, a cone can be viewed as a stack of circles with varying radius.  Modify the parametrizations of the circles above in order to construct the parameterization of a cone whose vertex lies at the origin, whose base radius is 4, and whose height is 3, where the base of the cone lies in the plane <m>z = 3</m>. Use appropriate technology to plot the parametric equations you develop. (Hint: The cross sections parallel to the <m>xy</m>-plane are circles, with the radii varying linearly as <m>z</m> increases.)

          <title>Parametric Surfaces</title>
          <p>
      In a single-variable setting, any function may have its graph expressed parametrically. For instance, given <m>y = g(x)</m>, by considering the parameterization <m>\langle t, g(t) \rangle</m> (where <m>t</m> belongs to the domain of <m>g</m>), we generate the same curve. What is more important is that certain curves that are not functions may be represented parametrically; for instance, the circle (which cannot be represented by a single function) can be parameterized by <m>\langle \cos(t), \sin(t) \rangle</m>, where <m>0 \le t \le 2\pi</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      In the same way, in a two-variable setting, the surface <m>z = f(x,y)</m> may be expressed parametrically by considering
      <me>
        \langle x(s,t), y(s,t), z(s,t) \rangle = \langle s, t, f(s,t) \rangle,
      </me>
      where <m>(s,t)</m> varies over the entire domain of <m>f</m>. Therefore, any familiar surface that we have studied so far can be generated as a parametric surface. But what is more powerful is that there are surfaces that cannot be generated by a single function <m>z = f(x,y)</m> (such as the unit sphere), but that can be represented parametrically. We now consider an important example.

          To find a parametrization of this torus, we recall our work in Preview

              <p>
          Let's focus our attention on one point on this circle, such as the
          indicated point, which has coordinates <m>(x(s), 0, z(s))</m>
          for a fixed value of the
          parameter <m>s</m>. When this point is revolved about the <m>z</m>-axis, we
          obtain a circle contained in a horizontal plane centered at
          <m>(0,0,z(s))</m> and having radius <m>x(s)</m>, as shown on the right of <xref ref="F_11_6_torus_revolve">Figure</xref>. If we let <m>t</m> be the new parameter that generates the circle for the rotation about the <m>z</m>-axis, this circle may be
          parametrized by
          <me>
            \vr(s,t) = x(s)\cos(t)\vi + x(s)\sin(t)\vj + z(s)\vk.
          </me>
        </p>
              <p>
          Now using our earlier parametric equations for <m>x(s)</m> and <m>z(s)</m> for the original smaller circle, we have an overall parameterization of the torus given by
          <me>
            \vr(s,t) =(b+a\cos(s))\cos(t)\vi + 
            (b+a\cos(s))\sin(t)\vj + 
            a\sin(s)\vk.

        </p>
              <p>
          To trace out the entire torus, we require that the parameters vary through the values <m>0\leq s\leq 2\pi</m> and
          <m>0\leq t\leq 2\pi</m>.

          <title>The Surface Area of Parametrically Defined Surfaces</title>
          <p>
      Recall that a differentiable function is locally linear <mdash/> that is, if we zoom in on the surface around a point, the surface looks like its tangent plane. We now exploit this idea in order to determine the surface area generated by a parametrization <m>\langle x(s,t), y(s,t), z(s,t) \rangle</m>. The basic idea is a familiar one: we will subdivide the surface into small pieces, in the approximate shape of small parallelograms, and thus estimate the entire the surface area by adding the areas of these approximation parallelograms. Ultimately, we use an integral to sum these approximations and determine the exact surface area.
    </p>
          <p>
      Let
      <me>
        \vr(s,t) = x(s,t) \vi + y(s,t) \vj + z(s,t) \vk
      </me>
      define a surface over a rectangular domain <m>a \leq s \leq b</m> and <m>c \leq t \leq d</m>. As a function of two variables, <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, it is natural to consider the two partial derivatives of the vector-valued function <m>\vr</m>, which we define by
      <md><mrow>
        \vr_s(s,t) \amp = x_s(s,t) \vi + y_s(s,t) \vj + z_s(s,t) \vk
        </mrow><mrow> 
        \vr_t(s,t) \amp = x_t(s,t) \vi + y_t(s,t) \vj + z_t(s,t) \vk.
        </mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      In the usual way, we slice the domain into small rectangles. In particular, we partition the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>m</m> subintervals of length <m>\Delta s = \frac{b-a}{n}</m> and let <m>s_0</m>, <m>s_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>s_m</m> be the endpoints of these subintervals, where <m>a = s_0\lt s_1\lt s_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  s_m = b</m>. Also partition the interval <m>[c,d]</m> into <m>n</m> subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta t = \frac{d-c}{n}</m> and let <m>t_0</m>, <m>t_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>t_n</m> be the endpoints of these subintervals, where <m>c = t_0\lt t_1\lt t_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  t_n = d</m>. These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle <m>R = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m> in <m>st</m>-coordinates into <m>mn</m> sub-rectangles <m>R_{ij}</m> with opposite vertices <m>(s_{i-1},t_{j-1})</m> and <m>(s_i, t_j)</m> for <m>i</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>m</m> and <m>j</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>n</m>. These rectangles all have equal area <m>\Delta A = \Delta s \cdot \Delta t</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Now we want to think about the small piece of area on the surface itself that lies above one of these small rectangles in the domain.
      Observe that if we increase <m>s</m> by a small amount <m>\Delta s</m> from the point
      <m>(s_{i-1},t_{j-1})</m> in the domain, then <m>\vr</m> changes by approximately
      <m>\vr_s(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta s</m>. Similarly, if we increase <m>t</m> by a
      small amount <m>\Delta t</m> from the point <m>(s_{i-1},t_{j-1})</m>, then <m>\vr</m>
      changes by approximately <m>\vr_t(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta t</m>. So we can
      approximate the surface defined by <m>\vr</m> on the <m>st</m>-rectangle
      <m>[s_{i-1},s_i] \times [t_{j-1}, t_{j}]</m> with the
      parallelogram determined by the vectors <m>\vr_s(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta
      s</m> and <m>\vr_t(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta t</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F_11_6_approx">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_11_6_approx">

          </figure>
          <p>
      Say that the small parallelogram has area <m>S_{ij}</m>. If we can find its area, then all that remains is to sum the areas of all of the generated parallelograms and take a limit. Recall from our earlier work in the course that given two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>, the area of the parallelogram spanned by <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> is given by the magnitude of their cross product, <m>| \vu \times \vv|</m>. In the present context, it follows that the area, <m>S_{ij}</m>, of the parallelogram determined by the vectors <m>\vr_s(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta s</m> and <m>\vr_t(s_{i-1},t_{j-1}) \Delta t</m> is

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      Since the parameterization is specified to be in terms of the
      radius <m>r</m> and angle <m>\theta</m>, we find <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m>
      in terms of the parameters <m>r = s</m> and <m>\theta = t</m>.  We have
      <me>x = s\cos t,</me><me>y = s\sin t,</me>
      and
      <me>z = 8 ( 1 - \frac{1}{9}\, s ),</me>
      with
      <me>0 \le s\le 9 \quad\mbox{and}\quad 0\le t\le 2\pi.</me>
      There are, of course, other parameterizations, but they will not be
      in terms of <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>, as required in this problem.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 




      To parameterize the plane we need two nonparallel vectors
      <m>\vec v_1</m> and <m>\vec v_2</m> that are parallel to the plane.  Such
      vectors are perpendicular to the normal  vector to the plane,
      <m>\vec n = \left\lt -5,4,2\right&gt;</m>.   We can choose any vectors <m>\vec v_1</m> and
      <m>\vec v_2</m> such that
      <m>\vec v_1\cdot \vec n = \vec v_2\cdot \vec n = 0</m>.




      One choice is
      <me>\vec v_1 = \left\lt -4,-5,0\right&gt;, \qquad \vec v_2 = \left\lt -2,0,-5\right&gt;.</me>




      Letting
      <m>\vec r_0 = \left\lt -5,-1,3\right&gt;</m>, we have
      the parameterization
      <me>\vec r(s, t) = \vec r_0+ s\vec v_1+t\vec v_2 =
      \left\lt -\left(5+4s+2t\right),-\left(1+5s\right),3-5t\right&gt;.</me></solution>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      The vase obtained by rotating the curve <m>z=2\sqrt{x-1}</m>,
      <m>1\le x\le 2</m>, around the <m>z</m>-axis is shown in the figure
      below.




      <sidebyside widths="57.5%"><image source="images/webwork-236-image-1.png"/></sidebyside>




      At height <m>z</m>, the cross-section is a horizontal circle of radius
      <m>a</m>.  Thus, letting the angle <m>\theta</m> around the <m>z</m>-axis be <m>t</m>,
      a point on this horizontal circle is given by
      <me>\vec r=a \cos t \vec i + a \sin t \vec j + z\vec k.</me>
      However, the radius <m>a</m> and height <m>z</m> are not independent.  We
      can parameterize easily in two ways: first, suppose that we take the
      radius <m>a</m> to be our second parameter, <m>a = s</m>.  Then, the height
      <m>z = 2\sqrt{s - 1}</m>, and our parameterization is
      <me>x(s,t) = s\cos t,</me><me>y(s,t) = s\sin t,</me>
      and
      <me>z(s,t) = 2\sqrt{s - 1},</me>
      with
      <me>1\le s\le 2 \quad\mbox{and}\quad 0\le t\le 2\pi.</me>
      Alternately, we could take the height <m>z</m> to be the second parameter,
      <m>z = s</m>.  Then, solving for the radius <m>r</m> in the expression for
      the curve, we get <m>a = \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + 1</m>.  Thus
      in this case the parameterization is
      <me>x(s,t) = \left((\frac{s}{2})^2 + 1\right)\,\cos(t),</me><me>y(s,t) = \left((\frac{s}{2})^2 + 1\right)\,\sin(t),</me>
      and
      <me>z(s,t) = s,</me>
      with
      <me>0\le s\le 2\quad\mbox{and}\quad 0\le t\le 2\pi.</me></solution>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      <alert>(a)</alert>
      Let <m>z</m> be measured from the bottom of the post, and the center
      of the post be at <m>x = 0</m>, <m>y = 0</m>.  The surface is the revolution
      surface obtained by revolving a curve extending vertically along one
      edge of the surface around the <m>z</m> axis, as suggested by the figure
      below.




      <sidebyside widths="28.8333333333333%"><image source="images/webwork-242-image-2.png"/></sidebyside>




      From the measurements given, we obtain the equation of the curve
      <me>x = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{6} z \right) + 5,
      \qquad 0 \leq z \leq 60.</me>



      Rotating this around the <m>z</m>-axis, taking <m>z=s</m> and <m>\theta = t</m>
      as the parameters, we get the parametric equations
      <me>x = (\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{6} s \right)+5)\cos t,</me><me>y = (\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{6} s \right)+5)\sin t,</me>
      and
      <me>z = s,</me>
      with
      <me>0 \leq s \leq 60, \qquad 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi.</me><alert>(b)</alert>
      We know that the points in the curve consists of cross-sections of circles
      parallel to the <m>xy</m> plane and of radius <m>\cos((\pi/{6})z+5)</m>.  Thus,
      <me>\mbox{Area of cross-section} 
      = \pi\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}z+5\right)\right)^2</me>
      Integrating over <m>z</m>, we get
      <me>\hbox{Volume } =
      \pi \int_0^{60} \left(\cos\frac{\pi}{6} z+5\right)^2 dz
       = \pi \int_0^{60} \left(\cos^2\frac{\pi}{6}z+10\cos\frac{\pi}{6}z
      		+25 \right) dz
       = 1530 \pi \mbox{ in}^3.</me></solution>

          <p>
      We have now learned that we define the double integral of a continuous function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> over a rectangle <m>R = [a,b] \times [c,d]</m> as a limit of a double Riemann sum, and that these ideas parallel the single-variable integral of a function <m>g = g(x)</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Moreover, this double integral has natural interpretations and applications, and can even be considered over non-rectangular regions, <m>D</m>. For instance, given a continuous function <m>f</m> over a region <m>D</m>, the average value of <m>f</m>, <m>f_{\operatorname{AVG}(D)}</m>, is given by
      <me>
        f_{\operatorname{AVG}(D)} = \frac{1}{A(D)} \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA,
      </me>
      where <m>A(D)</m> is the area of <m>D</m>. Likewise, if <m>\delta(x,y)</m> describes a mass density function on a lamina over <m>D</m>, the mass, <m>M</m>, of the lamina is given by
      <me>
        M = \iint_D \delta(x,y) \, dA.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      It is natural to wonder if it is possible to extend these ideas of double Riemann sums and double integrals for functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums and then triple integrals for functions of three variables. We begin investigating in <xref ref="PA_11_7">Preview Activity</xref>.

        Consider a solid piece of granite in the shape of a box <m>B = \{(x,y,z) : 0 \leq x \leq 4, 0 \leq y \leq 6, 0 \leq z \leq 8\}</m>, whose density varies from point to point. Let <m>\delta(x, y, z)</m> represent the mass density of the piece of granite at point <m>(x,y,z)</m> in kilograms per cubic meter (so we are measuring <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> in meters). Our goal is to find the mass of this solid.
      </p>
            <p>
        Recall that if the density was constant, we could find the mass by multiplying the density and volume; since the density varies from point to point, we will use the approach we did with two-variable lamina problems, and slice the solid into small pieces on which the density is roughly constant.

          <title>Triple Riemann Sums and Triple Integrals</title>
          <p>
      Through the application of a mass density distribution over a three-dimensional solid, <xref ref="PA_11_7">Preview Activity</xref> suggests that the generalization from double Riemann sums of functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums of functions of three variables is natural. In the same way, so is the generalization from double integrals to triple integrals. By simply adding a <m>z</m>-coordinate to our earlier work, we can define both a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding triple integral.
    </p>
          <definition>
            <statement>
              <p>
          Let <m>f = f(x,y,z)</m> be a continuous function on a box <m>B = [a,b] \times [c,d] \times [r,s]</m>. The <term>triple Riemann sum of <m>f</m> over <m>B</m></term><idx><h>triple Riemann sum</h></idx> is created as follows.

                Partition the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>m</m> subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{m}</m>. Let <m>x_0</m>, <m>x_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_m</m> be the endpoints of these subintervals, where <m>a = x_0\lt x_1\lt x_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  x_m = b</m>.
                Do likewise with the interval <m>[c,d]</m> using <m>n</m> subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta y = \frac{d-c}{n}</m> to generate <m>c = y_0\lt y_1\lt y_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  y_n = d</m>, and with the interval <m>[r,s]</m> using <m>\ell</m> subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta z = \frac{s-r}{\ell}</m> to have <m>r = z_0\lt z_1\lt z_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  z_l = s</m>.

                <me>
                  \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^{\ell} f(x_{ijk}^*, y_{ijk}^*, z_{ijk}^*) \cdot \Delta V.

      If <m>f(x,y,z)</m> represents the mass density of the box <m>B</m>, then, as we saw in <xref ref="PA_11_7">Preview Activity</xref>, the triple Riemann sum approximates the total mass of the box <m>B</m>. In order to find the exact mass of the box, we need to let the number of sub-boxes increase without bound (in other words, let <m>m</m>, <m>n</m>, and <m>\ell</m> go to infinity); in this case, the finite sum of the mass approximations becomes the actual mass of the solid <m>B</m>. More generally, we have the following definition of the triple integral.

We note this generalization of our work with functions of two variables along with several others in the following important boxed information.

                If we think about slicing up the solid, we can consider slicing the domain of the solid's projection onto the <m>xy</m>-plane (just as we would slice a two-dimensional region in <m>\R^2</m>), and then slice in the <m>z</m>-direction as well. The projection of the solid onto the <m>xy</m>-plane is shown at left in <xref ref="F_11_7_Cone_and_Cone_proj">Figure</xref>.

Note that over any point <m>(x,y)</m> in the plane, a vertical slice in the <m>z</m> direction will involve a range of values from the cone itself to its flat top.  In particular, observe that at least one of these limits is not constant but depends on <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

For example, two possibilities for iterated integrals that represent a triple integral <m>\iiint_S f(x,y,z) \, dV</m> over a solid <m>S</m> are
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_a^b \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} \int_{h_1(x,y)}^{h_2(x,y)} f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dy \, dx</m>
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_r^s \int_{p_1(z)}^{p_2(z)} \int_{q_1(x,z)}^{q_2(x,z)} f(x,y,z) \, dy \, dx \, dz</m>
          </p>
        </li></ul>
    </p>
          <p>
      where <m>g_1</m>, <m>g_2</m>, <m>h_1</m>, <m>h_2</m>, <m>p_1</m>, <m>p_2</m>, <m>q_1</m>, and <m>q_2</m> are functions of the indicated variables. There are four other options beyond the two stated here, since the variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> can (theoretically) be arranged in any order. Of course, in many circumstances, an insightful choice of variable order will make it easier to set up an iterated integral, just as was the case when we worked with double integrals.

              <p>
          We find the mass, <m>M</m>, of the tetrahedron by the triple integral
          <me>
            M = \iiint_S \delta(x,y,z) \, dV,
          </me>
          where <m>S</m> is the solid tetrahedron described above. In this example, we choose to integrate with respect to <m>z</m> first for the innermost integral. The top of the tetrahedron is given by the equation
          <me>
            x + 2 y + 3 z = 6;
          </me>
          solving for <m>z</m> then yields
          <me>
            z = \frac{1}{3}(6 - x - 2y).
          </me>
        </p>
              <p>
          The bottom of the tetrahedron is the <m>xy</m>-plane, so the limits on <m>z</m> in the iterated integral will be <m>0 \leq z \leq \frac{1}{3}(6-x-2y)</m>.
        </p>
              <p>
          To find the bounds on <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> we project the tetrahedron onto the <m>xy</m>-plane; this corresponds to setting <m>z = 0</m> in the equation <m>z = \frac{1}{3}(6 - x - 2y)</m>. The resulting relation between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is
          <me>
            x + 2 y = 6.
          </me>

              <p>
          The right image in <xref ref="F_11_7_Tetrahedron_ex">Figure</xref> shows the projection of the tetrahedron onto the <m>xy</m>-plane.
        </p>
              <p>
          If we choose to integrate with respect to <m>y</m> for the middle integral in the iterated integral, then the lower limit on <m>y</m> is the <m>x</m>-axis and the upper limit is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Note that the hypotenuse joins the points <m>(6,0)</m> and <m>(0,3)</m> and so has equation <m>y = 3 - \frac{1}{2}x</m>. Thus, the bounds on <m>y</m> are <m>0 \leq y \leq 3 - \frac{1}{2}x</m>. Finally, the <m>x</m> values run from 0 to 6, so the iterated integral that gives the mass of the tetrahedron is
          <men xml:id="eq_11_7_Tetrahedron_mass">
            M = \int_{0}^{6} \int_{0}^{3-(1/2)x} \int_{0}^{(1/3)(6-x-2y)} x+y+z \, dz \, dy \, dx.

      Setting up limits on iterated integrals can require considerable geometric intuition. It is important to not only create carefully labeled figures, but also to think about how we wish to slice the solid. Further, note that when we say <q>we will integrate first with respect to <m>x</m>,</q> by <q>first</q> we are referring to the innermost integral in the iterated integral. The next activity explores several different ways we might set up the integral in the preceding example.

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      The region of integration the region in the first octant below the
      plane <m>z = 12 - 4 x - 3 y</m>.  Note that the projection of this
      into the <m>xy</m>-plane is the triangular region below
      <m>y = 4 - \frac{4}{3} x</m>.



      The mass of the volume is then
      <me>M = \int_R \delta\,dV =
          \int_0^3\int_0^{4 - \frac{4}{3} x}\int_0^{12-4 x-3 y}\,x + 2 y\,dz\,dy\,dx.</me>
      Integrating with respect to <m>z</m>,
      <me>M = \int_0^3\int_0^{4 - \frac{4}{3} x} (x + 2 y)(12-4 x-3 y)\,dy\,dx</me>
      so that
      <me>M = \int_0^3\int_0^{4 - \frac{4}{3} x} -4 x^2 + 12 x - 3 x y - 8 x y +
      	24 y - 6 y^2\,dy\,dx.</me>
      Then, integrating with respect to <m>y</m>,
      <me>M = \int_0^3 (-4 x^2 + 12 x)(4 - \frac{4}{3} x) +
      	\frac12(24 - 11 x)(4 - \frac{4}{3} x)^2 - 2 (4 - \frac{4}{3} x)^3\,dx.</me>
      Expanding the these terms, we have
      <me>M = \int_0^3 \frac{8}{27} x^3 + \frac{16}{3} x^2  - 40 x + 64\, dx = 66.</me></solution>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      The volume <m>V</m> of the solid is <m>3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27</m>.
      Thus for <m>I_x</m> we have
      <me>I_x = \frac{27}{27}\int_W\, y^2 + z^2\,dV =
          1\int_0^3\int_0^3\int_0^3\,y^2 + z^2\,dz\,dy\,dx.</me>
      This is
      <me>I_x = 1\int_0^3\int_0^3 y^2 z + \frac13 z^3\bigg|_{z=0}^{z=3} = 
        1\int_0^{3}\int_0^{3}\, 3 y^2 + 9\, dy\,dx,</me>
      or
      <me>I_x = 1\int_0^3 27 + 27\, dx = 162.</me>

      Similarly,
      <me>I_y = 162,\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad I_z = 162.</me></solution>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      The total volume of the cone is
      <m>\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h = \frac{125}{3}\pi</m>, so the total
      mass is <m>125 \pi</m> (since the density is always 3).
      The center of mass
      <m>z</m>-coordinate is given by
      <me>\overline{z} = \frac{1}{125 \pi} \int_C z \,dV</me>
      Using cylindrical coordinates to evaluate this integral gives
      <me>\overline{z} = \frac{1}{125 \pi}
        \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{5} \int_0^z 3 z r\,dr \,dz \,d\theta,</me>
      so
      <me>\overline{z} = \frac{1}{125 \pi}
        \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{5} 3\cdot \frac{z^3}{2} \,dz \,d\theta
        =  \left(\frac{1}{125 \pi}\right)\left(2\pi\right)
      	3\cdot \frac{625}{8} = \frac{15}{4}\mbox{ cm}.</me></solution>

          <p>
      We have encountered two different coordinate systems in <m>\R^2</m> <mdash/> the rectangular and polar coordinates systems <mdash/> and seen how in certain situations, polar coordinates form a convenient alternative. In a similar way, there are two additional natural coordinate systems in <m>\R^3</m>. Given that we are already familiar with the Cartesian coordinate system for <m>\R^3</m>, we next investigate the cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems (each of which builds upon polar coordinates in <m>\R^2</m>). In what follows, we will see how to convert among the different coordinate systems, how to evaluate triple integrals using them, and some situations in which these other coordinate systems prove advantageous.

        In the following questions, we investigate the two new coordinate systems that are the subject of this section: cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Our goal is to consider some examples of how to convert from rectangular coordinates to each of these systems, and vice versa. Triangles and trigonometry prove to be particularly important.

      As we stated in <xref ref="PA_11_8">Preview Activity</xref>, the cylindrical coordinates<idx><h>cylindrical coordinates</h></idx> of a point are <m>(r,\theta,z)</m>, where <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> are the polar coordinates of the point <m>(x, y)</m>, and <m>z</m> is the same <m>z</m> coordinate as in Cartesian coordinates. The general situation is illustrated <xref ref="F_11_8_Cylindrical_coords">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Since we already know how to convert between rectangular and polar coordinates in the plane, and the <m>z</m> coordinate is identical in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates, the conversion equations between the two systems in <m>\R^3</m> are essentially those we found for polar coordinates.

      Just as with rectangular coordinates, where we usually write <m>z</m> as a function of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to plot the resulting surface, in cylindrical coordinates, we often express <m>z</m> as a function of <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>.

          <p>
      To evaluate a triple integral <m>\iiint_S f(x,y,z) \, dV</m> as an iterated integral in Cartesian coordinates, we use the fact that the volume element <m>dV</m> is equal to <m>dz \, dy \, dx</m> (which corresponds to the volume of a small box). To evaluate a triple integral in cylindrical coordinates, we similarly must understand the volume element <m>dV</m> in cylindrical coordinates.

      When it comes to thinking about particular surfaces in spherical coordinates, similar to our work with cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates, we usually write <m>\rho</m> as a function of <m>\theta</m> and <m>\phi</m>; this is a natural analog to polar coordinates, where we often think of our distance from the origin in the plane as being a function of <m>\theta</m>. In spherical coordinates, we likewise often view <m>\rho</m> as a function of <m>\theta</m> and <m>\phi</m>, thus viewing distance from the origin as a function of two key angles.
    </p>
          <p>
      In the following activity, we explore several basic equations in spherical coordinates and the surfaces they generate.

          <title>Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates</title>
          <p>
      As with rectangular and cylindrical coordinates, a triple integral <m>\iiint_S f(x,y,z) \, dV</m> in spherical coordinates can be evaluated as an iterated integral once we understand the volume element <m>dV</m>.
    </p>

            <p>
        To find the volume element <m>dV</m> in spherical coordinates, we need to understand how to determine the volume of a spherical box of the form <m>\rho_1 \leq \rho \leq \rho_2</m> (with <m>\Delta \rho = \rho_2-\rho_1)</m>, <m>\phi_1 \leq \phi \leq \phi_2</m> (with <m>\Delta \phi = \phi_2-\phi_1</m>), and <m>\theta_1 \leq \theta \leq \theta_2</m> (with <m>\Delta \theta = \theta_2-\theta_1</m>). An illustration of such a box is given at left in <xref ref="F_11_8_Spherical_Vol_Element">Figure</xref>. This spherical box is a bit more complicated than the cylindrical box we encountered earlier. In this situation, it is easier to approximate the volume <m>\Delta V</m> than to compute it directly. Here we can approximate the volume <m>\Delta V</m> of this spherical box with the volume of a Cartesian box whose sides have the lengths of the sides of this spherical box. In other words,
        <me>
          \Delta V \approx |PS| \ |\overset{\frown}{PR}| \ |\overset{\frown}{PQ}|,

      In single variable calculus, we encountered the idea of a change of variable in a definite integral through the method of substitution. For example, given the definite integral
      <me>
        \int_0^2 2x(x^2+1)^3 \, dx,
      </me>
      we naturally consider the change of variable <m>u = x^2+1</m>. From this substitution, it follows that <m>du = 2x \, dx</m>, and since <m>x = 0</m> implies <m>u = 1</m> and <m>x = 2</m> implies <m>u = 5</m>, we have transformed the original integral in <m>x</m> into a new integral in <m>u</m>. In particular,
      <me>
        \int_0^2 2x(x^2+1)^3 \, dx = \int_1^5 u^3 \, du.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      The latter integral, of course, is far easier to evaluate.
    </p>
          <p>
      Through our work with polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates, we have already implicitly seen some of the issues that arise in using a change of variables with two or three variables present. In what follows, we seek to understand the general ideas behind any change of variables in a multiple integral.

        <subsection>
          <title>Change of Variables in Polar Coordinates</title>
          <p>
      The general idea behind a change of variables is suggested by <xref ref="PA_11_9">Preview Activity</xref>. There, we saw that in a change of variables from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, a polar rectangle <m>[r_1, r_2] \times [\theta_1, \theta_2]</m> gets mapped to a Cartesian rectangle under the transformation
      <me>
        x = r \cos(\theta)  \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ y = r \sin(\theta).
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      The vertices of the polar rectangle <m>P</m> are transformed into the vertices
      of a closed and bounded region <m>P'</m> in rectangular coordinates. If we view the standard coordinate system as having the horizontal axis represent <m>r</m> and the vertical axis represent <m>\theta</m>, then the polar rectangle <m>P</m> appears to us at left in <xref ref="F_11_9_Change_vars1_a">Figure</xref>. The image <m>P'</m> of the polar rectangle <m>P</m> under the transformation given by <xref ref="eq_11_9_pol_to_rect"/> is shown at right in <xref ref="F_11_9_Change_vars1_a">Figure</xref>. We thus see that there is a correspondence between a simple region (a traditional, right-angled rectangle) and a more complicated region (a fraction of an annulus) under the function <m>T</m> given by <m>T(r, \theta) = (r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta))</m>.
    </p>
          <figure xml:id="F_11_9_Change_vars1_a">
            <caption>A rectangle <m>P</m> and its image <m>P'</m>.</caption>
            <image width="100%" source="images/fig_11_9_polar_change"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      Furthermore, as <xref ref="PA_11_9">Preview Activity</xref> suggests, it follows generally that for an original polar rectangle <m>P = [r_1, r_2] \times [\theta_1, \theta_2]</m>, the area of the transformed rectangle <m>P'</m> is given by <m>\frac{r_2+r_1}{2} \Delta r \Delta \theta</m>. Therefore, as <m>\Delta r</m> and <m>\Delta \theta</m> go to 0 this area becomes the familiar area element <m>dA = r \, dr \, d\theta</m> in polar coordinates. When we proceed to working with other transformations for different changes in coordinates, we have to understand how the transformation affects area so that we may use the correct area element in the new system of variables.

          <title>General Change of Coordinates</title>
          <p>
      We first focus on double integrals. As with single integrals, we may be able to simplify a double integral of the form
      <me>
        \iint_D f(x,y) \, dA
      </me>
      by making a change of variables (that is, a substitution) of the form
      <me>
        x = x(s, t) \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \  y = y(s, t)
      </me>
      where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are functions of new variables <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>. This transformation introduces a correspondence between a problem in the <m>xy</m>-plane and one in the the <m>st</m>-plane. The equations <m>x=x(s,t)</m> and <m>y=y(s,t)</m> convert <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> to <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>; we call these formulas the <em>change of variable</em> formulas. To complete the change to the new <m>s,t</m> variables, we need to understand the area element, <m>dA</m>, in this new system. The following activity helps to illustrate the idea.

              To transform an integral with a change of variables,  we need to determine the area element <m>dA</m> for image of the  transformed rectangle.

How would we find the area of a parallelogram that approximates the area of the <m>xy</m>-figure <m>T'</m>? (Hint: Remember what the cross product of two vectors tells us.)

          <p>
      <xref ref="A_11_9_1">Activity</xref> presents the general idea of how a change of variables works. We partition a rectangular domain in the <m>st</m> system into subrectangles. Let <m>T = [a, b] \times [a+\Delta s, b+\Delta t]</m> be one of these subrectangles. Then we transform this into a region <m>T'</m> in the standard <m>xy</m> Cartesian coordinate system. The region <m>T'</m> is called the <em>image</em> of <m>T</m>; the region <m>T</m> is the <em>pre-image</em> of <m>T'</m>. Although the sides of this <m>xy</m> region <m>T'</m> aren't necessarily straight (linear), we will approximate the element of area <m>dA</m> for this region with the area of the parallelogram whose sides are given by the vectors <m>\vv</m> and <m>\vw</m>, where <m>\vv</m> is the vector from <m>(x(a, b), y(a, b))</m> to <m>(x(a + \Delta s, b), y(a + \Delta s, b))</m>, and <m>\vw</m> is the vector from <m>(x(a, b), y(a, b))</m> to <m>(x(a, b + \Delta t), y(a, b + \Delta t))</m>.

      The components of the vector <m>\vv</m> are

      and similarly those for <m>\vw</m> are
      <md><mrow>\vw \amp = \left\langle x(a, b+ \Delta t) - x(a,b), y(a, b+ \Delta s) - y(a,b), 0 \right\rangle.</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      Slightly rewriting <m>\vv</m> and <m>\vw</m>, we have
      <md><mrow>\vv \amp = \left\langle \frac{x(a+ \Delta s, b) - x(a,b)}{\Delta s}, \frac{y(a+ \Delta s, b) - y(a,b)}{\Delta s}, 0 \right\rangle \Delta s, \ \mbox{and}</mrow><mrow>\vw \amp = \left\langle \frac{x(a, b+ \Delta t) - x(a,b)}{\Delta t}, \frac{y(a, b+ \Delta s) - y(a,b)}{\Delta t}, 0 \right\rangle \Delta t.</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      For small <m>\Delta s</m> and <m>\Delta t</m>, the definition of the partial derivative tells us that
      <me>
        \vv \approx \left\langle \frac{\partial x}{\partial s}(a,b), \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}(a,b), 0 \right\rangle \Delta s \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \  \vw \approx \left\langle \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}(a,b), \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(a,b), 0 \right\rangle \Delta t.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Recall that the area of the parallelogram with sides <m>\vv</m> and <m>\vw</m> is the length of the cross product of the two vectors, <m>|\vv \times \vw|</m>. From this, we observe that
      <md><mrow>\vv \times \vw \amp \approx \left\langle \frac{\partial x}{\partial s}(a,b), \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}(a,b), 0 \right\rangle \Delta s \times \left\langle \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}(a,b), \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(a,b), 0 \right\rangle \Delta t</mrow><mrow>\amp = \left\langle 0, \ 0, \ \frac{\partial x}{\partial s}(a,b) \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(a,b) - \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}(a,b) \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}(a,b) \right\rangle \Delta s \, \Delta t.</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      Finally, by computing the magnitude of the cross product, we see that
      <md><mrow>|\vv \times \vw| \amp \approx \left|\left\langle 0,0, \frac{\partial x}{\partial s}(a,b) \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(a,b) - \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}(a,b) \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}(a,b) \right\rangle \Delta s \, \Delta t\right|</mrow><mrow>\amp = \left|\frac{\partial x}{\partial s}(a,b) \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(a,b) - \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}(a,b) \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}(a,b)\right| \Delta s \, \Delta t.</mrow></md>
    </p>
          <p>
      Therefore, as the number of subdivisions increases without bound in each direction, <m>\Delta s</m> and <m>\Delta t</m> both go to zero, and we have
      <men xml:id="E_Area_Element">
        dA = \left|\frac{\partial x}{\partial s} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} \frac{\partial y}{\partial s} \right| ds \, dt.

    </p>
          <p>
      Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="E_Area_Element"/> hence determines the general change of variable formula in a double integral, and we can now say that
      <me>
        \iint_T f(x,y) \, dy \, dx = \iint_{T'} f(x(s,t),y(s,t)) \left|\frac{\partial x}{\partial s} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}\right| ds \, dt.

      </me>
      is called the <em>Jacobian</em><idx><h>Jacobian</h></idx>, and we denote the Jacobian using the shorthand notation
      <me>
        \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (s,t)}  =  \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}.
      </me>
      Recall from <xref ref="S-9-4-Cross-Product">Section</xref> that we can also write this Jacobian as the determinant of the <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix
        <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cc} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} \amp  \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}  \\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial s} \amp  \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} 
        \end{array}  \right] </m>.
      Note that, as discussed in <xref ref="S-9-4-Cross-Product">Section</xref>, the absolute value of the determinant of <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cc} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} \amp  \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}  \\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial s} \amp  \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} 
        \end{array}  \right]</m> is the area of the parallelogram determined by the vectors <m>\vv</m> and <m>\vw</m>, and so the area element <m>dA</m> in <m>xy</m>-coordinates is also represented by the area element <m>\left| \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (s,t)} \right| \, ds \, dt</m> in <m>st</m>-coordinates, and <m>\left| \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (s,t)} \right|</m> is the factor by which the transformation magnifies area.

      To summarize, the preceding change of variable formula that we have derived now follows.

          <title>Change of Variables in a Triple Integral</title>
          <p>
     The argument for the change of variable formula for triple integrals is complicated, and we will not go into the details. The general process, though, is the same as the two-dimensional case. Given a solid <m>S'</m> in the <m>xyz</m>-coordinate system in <m>\R^3</m>, a change of variables transformation <m>x=x(s,t,u)</m>, <m>y=y(s,t,u)</m>, and <m>z = z(s,t,u)</m> transforms <m>S'</m> into a region <m>S</m> in <m>stu</m>-coordinates. Any function <m>f = f(x,y,z)</m> defined on <m>S'</m> can be considered as a function <m>f = f(x(s,t,u), y(s,y,u), z(s,t,u))</m> in <m>stu</m>-coordinates defined on <m>S</m>. The volume element <m>dV</m> in <m>xyz</m>-coordinates cooresponds to a scaled volume element in <m>stu</m>-coordinates, where the scale factor is given by the absolute value of the Jacobian, <m>\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(s,t,u)}</m>, which is the determinant of the <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix
        <me>
          \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} \amp  \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} \amp  \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial s} \amp  \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \amp  \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \\ \frac{\partial z}{\partial s} \amp  \frac{\partial z}{\partial t} \amp  \frac{\partial z}{\partial u}
        \end{array}  \right]
        </me>. 
      (Recall that this determinant was introduced in <xref ref="S-9-4-Cross-Product">Section</xref>.) That is, <m>\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(s,t,u)}</m> is given by  
       <me>
        \frac{\partial x}{\partial s}\left[\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\frac{\partial z}{\partial u} - \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}\right] - \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}\left[\frac{\partial y}{\partial s}\frac{\partial z}{\partial u} - \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}\frac{\partial z}{\partial s}\right] + \frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\left[\frac{\partial y}{\partial s}\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\frac{\partial z}{\partial s}\right].

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      We must change variables in the area element <m>dA=\,dx\,dy</m>, the
      integrand <m>x</m> and the region <m>R</m>.



      Inverting the variable change gives <m>x=\sqrt{s-t}</m>, <m>y=s</m> where we use
      the positive square root because the region <m>R</m> is in the first
      quadrant where <m>x\ge 0</m>. Thus
      <me>\frac{\partial (x, y)}{\partial (s, t)}= \left\vert
      \begin{array}{cc}\frac{\partial x}{\partial s}\amp \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}\\
      \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}\amp \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\end{array}\right\vert
      =\left\vert
      \begin{array}{cc}1/(2\sqrt{s-t})\amp \quad -1/(2\sqrt{s-t})\\ 1\amp 0\end{array}\right\vert =
      \frac{1}{2\sqrt{s-t}}.</me>
      Therefore
      <me>dx\,dy = 
      \left\vert \frac{\partial (x, y)}{\partial (s, t)}\right\vert \,ds\,dt
        =\frac{1}{2\sqrt{s-t}} \,ds\,dt.</me>



      The integrand is <m>x = \sqrt{s-t}</m>.



      The region of integration can be transformed by examination of its
      boundaries. The left and right boundaries of <m>R</m> are given by
      <m>y-x^2=t=0</m> and <m>y-x^2 = t =-1</m>. The
      bottom and top boundaries of  given by <m>y=s=0</m> and <m>y=s=36</m>.




      Let <m>T</m> be the rectangle <m>0\le s\le 36</m>, <m>-1\le t \le 0</m> of
      area <m>(1)(36)= 36</m>. We
      have
      <me>\int\int_R x\,dx\,dy= \int\int_T \sqrt{s-t}\frac{1}{2\sqrt{s-t}} \,ds\,dt=
      \frac{1}{2}(\hbox{Area of T}) = 18.</me></solution>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      The area of the ellipse is <m>\int\int_R \,dx\,dy</m> where <m>R</m>
      is the region <m>x^2 + 2 x y + 2 y^2\le 1</m>.  We must change
      variables in both the area element <m>dA=\,dx\,dy</m>
      and the region <m>R</m>.



      Inverting the variable change gives <m>x = s -  t</m>, <m>y = t</m>. Thus
      <me>\frac{\partial (x, y)}{\partial (s, t)}=
      \left\vert
      \begin{array}{cc}
      \frac{\partial x}{\partial s}\amp \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}\\
      \frac{\partial y}{\partial s}\amp \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
      \end{array}
      \right\vert
      =
      \left\vert
      \begin{array}{cr}
      1 \amp  -1\\
      0\amp 1
      \end{array}
      \right\vert = 1.</me>
      Therefore
      <me>dx\,dy= \left\vert \frac{\partial (x, y)}{\partial (s, t)}\right\vert \,ds\,dt = \,ds\,dt.</me>



      The region of integration is
      <me>x^2 + 2 x y + 2 y^2 = (s -  t)^2+ 2(s -  t)t + 2 t^2 =
      s^2+t^2\le 1.</me>



      Let <m>T</m> be the unit disc <m>s^2+t^2\le 1</m>. We have
      <me>\int\int_R \,dx\,dy= \int\int_T \,ds\,dt =  \hbox{Area of }T = \pi.</me></solution>

       SOLUTION 



      Given

      we have

      \begin{array}{ccc}
      \frac{\partial s}{\partial x} \amp \frac{\partial s}{\partial y}\\
      \frac{\partial t}{\partial x} \amp \frac{\partial t}{\partial y}
      \end{array}\right|
      =\left|\begin{array}{ccc}y\amp x\\y^2\amp 2xy\end{array}\right|=xy^2=t.</me>
      Since  <me>\frac{\partial(s,t)}{\partial(x,y)}\cdot
      \frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(s,t)}=1,
      \qquad
       \frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(s,t)}=\frac{1}{t}.</me>

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      The square <m>T</m> is defined by the inequalities 
      <me>0 \le s = ax \le 1 \qquad
        0\le t=by\le 1</me>
      that correspond to the inequalities
      <me>0\le x \le 1/a = 30 \qquad
        0\le y \le 1/b = 65</me>
      that define <m>R</m>.   Thus <m>a=1/30</m> and <m>b=1/65</m>.



      Then, we have <m>x = 30 s</m> and <m>y = 65 t</m>, so
      <me>\left\vert \frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(s,t)}\right\vert =
      \left|\begin{array}{cc}
        30 \amp  0 \\

       SOLUTION 



      Inverting the change of
      variables gives <m>x = s-at</m>, <m>y=t</m>.
      The four edges of <m>R</m> are
      <me>y=0, y=8, y=-\frac{1}{3} x, y=-\frac{1}{3} (x-18).</me>
      The change of variables transforms the edges to
      <me>t=0, t=8, t=-\frac{1}{3} s + \frac{1}{3} at,
      t=-\frac{1}{3} s + \frac{1}{3} at + 6.</me>
      These are  equations for the edges of a rectangle in the <m>st</m>-plane
      if the last two are of the form: <m>s=(\hbox{Constant})</m>.  This happens
      when the <m>t</m> terms drop out,
      or <m>a=3</m>. With <m>a=3</m> the change of variables gives
      <me>\int\int_T \left\vert
          \frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(s,t)}\right\vert \,ds\,dt</me>
      over the rectangle
      <me>T: 0\le  t \le 8, 0\le  s\le 18.</me>




      The jacobian <m>\left\vert\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(s,t)}\right\vert</m>
      is
      <me>\left\vert\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(s,t)}\right\vert =

      <solution>


       SOLUTION 



      Given
      <me>\begin{array}{ccc}
          x \amp  = \amp  4 s + t\\
          y \amp  = \amp  s - 3 t,
      \end{array}</me>
      we have
      <me>\left|\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(s,t)}\right| =
        \left|\begin{array}{cc}
          \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} \amp  \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}\\
          \frac{\partial y}{\partial s} \amp  \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
        \end{array}\right|
        =\left|\begin{array}{cc}
          4 \amp  1 \\
          1 \amp  -3
        \end{array}\right| = |-13|,</me>
      hence
      <me>\left|\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(s,t)}\right| = 13.</me>
      We therefore get
      <me>\int_R (x+y) \,dA =
          \int_{T} ((4 s + t) + (s - 3 t))
              \left|\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(s,t)}\right|dsdt =</me><me>\int_{T}(5s-2t)(13)\,ds\,dt=\int_{T} (13\!\left(5s-2t\right))\,ds\,dt,</me>
      where <m>T</m> is the region in the <m>st</m>-plane corresponding
      to <m>R</m>.




      Now, we need to find  <m>T</m>.

      Because
      <me>\begin{array}{ccc}
          x \amp  = \amp  4 s+ t \\
          y \amp  = \amp  s - 3 t
      \end{array}</me>
      we can use the boundaries of the region <m>R</m> to find the boundaries
      of <m>T</m>.  Using the four vertices of the parallelogram <m>R</m>, we the
      edges <m>y = \frac1{4}\,x</m>, <m>y = -3\,x</m>, <m>y = \frac{1}{4}\,(x-3) - 9</m> and
      <m>y = -3(x - 4) + 1</m>.  So, from the above transformation, the boundaries
      are <m>t = 0</m>, <m>s = 0</m>, <m>t = 3</m> and <m>s = 1</m>.
      Therefore
      <me>\int_R(x+y)\,dA = \int_{0}^{3} \int_{0}^{1}\, 13\!\left(5s-2t\right) \,ds\,dt
        = \frac{-39}{2}.</me>
      (Alternately, we could of course also write the integral as
      <m>\int_{3}^{0} \int_{1}^{0}\, 13\!\left(5s-2t\right) \,ds\,dt</m>.)
